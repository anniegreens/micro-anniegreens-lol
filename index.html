			 <p>Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. The only permanent forever lockdown is what is <em>currently</em> being imposed on many chronically ill, disabled, and immunocompromised people right now in 2024. These common sense measures would help curb every single airborne disease, prepare us for more (there will be more), and would slash the cost to society we are currently burdened with under &ldquo;let it rip&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Another garden status only four days later, what is <em>happening</em>?! Well not much more than <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/08/21/garden-status.html">the last one</a> but I took some very lovely shots this morning and just want to share. I am fairly obsessed with the digitalis, so there are a couple of that, as well as some other progress shots of later bloomers.</p>
<p>But first, an update on the Mexican snowball echeveria, which has put up some babies! I had to protect this twice from rainstorms. It probably would have been fine, but they don&rsquo;t really like to be overly wet, so I put a small plastic pot to over it, upside down. The plastic pot has several holes in the bottom allowing some of the rain to get through but at least protected it from being deluged. I will be taking the echeveria under the patio for the winter.</p>

			 <p>The name is <em>Monsieur Spade</em> about Sam Spade of <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. This is to have taken place after those events when Spade inadvertently moved to France in retirement and married an older woman after being paid to take a young girl to her father after her mother‚Äôs death. He ends up investigating a gruesome murder at a convent.</p>
<p>It is about as interesting as anything else in the series to watch Clive Owen, playing Spade, an American, try to keep up an American accent, himself British, while occasionally speaking French and talking to French people with very thick accents. I‚Äôve seen his accent slip a few times, but he‚Äôs doing pretty good. Must be very hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only on episode two of six and curious to see where this goes. I find that these limited series often do a better job with a story arc than series with endless seasons. Wikipedia describes this as &ldquo;American neo-noir&rdquo; with the following synopsis from the miniseries:</p>

I like to use these to reflect on everything I&rsquo;ve written during the time since the last note, and that usually means it will cover most everything I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve done much, but I&rsquo;ve definitely written a lot.</p>

<p>This week I am taking my first real break from posting to <a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a> since I started the challenge. I am 59/100 posts in and feeling pretty good about it. The decision to take Sundays off from posting was a good idea and I think I&rsquo;ve only missed one other day so far, other than this week. I also decided how I think I&rsquo;ll use the blog after I finish this initial challenge, and that is to make it my own personal challenge space with my own hashtag: #100DaysofBlog.</p>
<h2 id="3x5pics">3x5.pics</h2>
<p>Not much new here, other than still posting a small note every four days relevant to contemporary happenings globally/nationally/personally in my life. I did not get to be in the finalists for the <a href="https://tinyawards.net/">Tiny Awards</a> and after seeing the types of things that <em>did</em> I&rsquo;m not at all surprised or hurt. All the finalists are fantastic. I think there is still time to vote, so if you haven&rsquo;t yet, give it a go!</p>
<h2 id="weblog-themescustomstyles">Weblog Themes/Custom/Styles</h2>
<p>I finally got around to posting an update to <a href="https://themes.lol">themes.lol</a> on the homepage. Noted in that post was my completion of <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/definitions">Defintions</a> and a start on Shortcodes, as well as the <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/2024/07/customizing-a-weblog-homepage">Customizing a weblog homepage</a> post. Other than the update post I didn&rsquo;t get much else done over there except working on Shortcodes and updating my todo list with some new items.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t done a garden status in quite a while. I do not tend to get out into the garden as much during the height of summer when it is just too hot and sunny for my liking. When I do get out there it is to finish a specific task early or later in the day and then I&rsquo;m back inside or resting on the shaded patio.</p>
<p>We have a brief hiatus in heat this week and may actually have a few days of rain. The garden is starting to go into &ldquo;late summer&rdquo; mode when some of the later blooming plants get going, I&rsquo;ve been trying to add more of these over the last several years. When the garden was younger, I had mostly spring blooming plants and that left a dearth of blooms during the summer months. Now I have more going on later, whether it be perennials that push a second (or third) flush, or plants that just do not start blooming until August and then go until frost.</p>
<p>Starting with an agapanthus that has been rather disappointing since I planted it. It&rsquo;s probably my fault. Agapanthus love to be root bound, and I only bought one plant and then divided it immediately. The first year I only got one bloom head on one of the halves. The second year I only got one sparse bloom head on the other half. Last year I got no blooms at all. This year I dug one of the halves out and am going to put it into a container and compare how the two halves perform from here on out. Here is the larger of the two halves, finally putting on some size and pushing a nice bloom head this year.</p>

			 <p>I just went around changing six smoke detector batteries and backup batteries because one of them randomly went off and I couldn&rsquo;t tell which one it was. I&rsquo;m in the habit of changing them all at the same time any time I need to replace the batteries in one so that I always know how old they all are.</p>
<p>The worst part about this task is that you&rsquo;re up on a step stool or ladder so you can reach the dang things, then you need a hand to push the test button, so you only have one free hand to plug one ear, and then you end up deaf and ringing in the other ear for the next hour or two.</p>
<p>Now marking on the calendar this date so I in six months I can probably do this all over again. Four of them are the same and are not hard-wired, but I had to replace them all a couple years ago because they all expired, which is still a weird thing to me. I understand there are compounds that age and break down inside of them. This also means you can&rsquo;t just toss them in the trash. The two upstairs are hard-wired so they only have a back-up battery in them. Luckily they all have the same little access panel that slides over to replace the batteries without having to take them off their mounts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really love to be able to use the Eve Home smoke detectors because then I&rsquo;d have information about them in my Home app. I&rsquo;d be able to see the status of the batteries and probably when they were last changed. I assume I would also get a notice on my phone or other device letting me know when it is time to change the batteries or which one is going off in the case one goes off. But for some reason they are not available in the US, only Europe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because this time <em>is</em> different. I won&rsquo;t stop sharing this stuff. It&rsquo;s the fight of my life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have always been viruses, and there have always been immunocompromised people, but prior to COVID there was never this level of viral spread, with a virus of this severity, with this ability to reinfect, with this level of transmissibility. Immunocompromised people are under constant siege, with levels of disease unseen in modern times being normalized in all public spaces.</p>
<p>For many disabled and immunocompromised people, segregation is as complete as their need to avoid COVID. Indoor dining, of course, is out. Going to bars, happy hours, work events, weddings, conferences, parties, anything where large groups of people gather is a risk, even in a high-quality mask which will leave you unable to eat, drink, and a likely target for snide remarks and mocking jokes. Because again, the political messaging coming from the top encourages healthy people not only not to protect vulnerable people, but to mock and deride them.&quot;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/08/10/my-me-life.html">My ME Life: Lessons learned from Shingles</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/08/10/my-me-life.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-10 09:53:36 -0700">Aug 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today&rsquo;s entry in this series‚Äîit has been a while‚Äîhas me remembering that time I had Shingles. The reason this comes up now is several-fold: many people are seeing themselves having Shingles right now following an initial or repeat Covid infection; I similarly had Shingles during some of my sickest years with ME/CFS prior to a remission; and it is an important lesson in mild or asymptomatic infection still leading to evidence of viral persistence and the long tail of chronic vs acute illness.</p>
<p>I was in my early- to mid-20s, definitely not what is the expected age for Shingles. In fact, today you can&rsquo;t even get a Shingles vaccine until you are over 50 (unless approved by a doctor). Shingles is caused by the same virus as Chicken Pox. If you had Chicken Pox as a child you have this virus still residing in your body. This is what viruses do. Many common (and not so common) viruses take up residence in reservoirs and tissue and lie in wait to be reactivated later for any number of reasons, usually an additional stress or illness, and then can cause a whole new slew of terrible and more damaging illness than the acute stage of the virus. That is exactly what Long Covid is, by the way.</p>
<p>Very often the acute state of a viral infection can be mild or asymptomatic. In my case, my sister, a few years older than me, had Chicken Pox. My parents, like many other parents in a wave of copy-cat like behavior, were led to believe the right thing to do was put us together &ldquo;to get it over with&rdquo; so we would both be sick at the same time. I never responded with a symptomatic infection. I never had a breakout of pox/bumps and the associated symptoms of Chicken Pox. Did I <em>have</em> Chicken Pox? Well, yes, because two decades later I had Shingles.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that even with a mild or asymptomatic viral infection, you can still end up with a chronic condition from that virus. Likewise, you can have a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; or asymptomatic Covid infection and still end up chronically ill and disabled with Long Covid. Many asymptomatic infections are a result of your immune system being <em>unable</em> to mount a response, where your body may already be too sick or damaged to show signs of an infection. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t sick, it likely means more damage, unseen, is occurring within your body.</p>
<p>My case of Shingles was considered out of the ordinary for someone who appeared to be well, yet with a chronic illness, ME/CFS. Up until the last ten years or so, ME/CFS was still widely ignored and refuted by medical professionals. Some of this still persists today and is being taken up again in the fight to recognize Long Covid. It took me around five years to get any sort of answer about my condition and be told I have ME/CFS. Even afterwards I was psychologized, told to push through it, that the will to get &ldquo;better&rdquo; was in my head and my own fault. With Shingles too I was first told it was a rash, even when I explained the terrible pain I was in.</p>
<p>Shingles, if untreated, can damage nerves, internal organs, and cause blindness if on the face. This is why it can appear to &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; your body. For me it was on the side of my torso and wrapped around the front to my belly. To this day, I still have lingering pain sometimes and wonder if there is internal damage due to the length of time it took for my doctor to recognize what it was and agree to treat me. Treatment is an anti-viral. If that sounds familiar, that may be because acute treatment of Covid is also an anti-viral. They work to stop viral replication from occurring inside the body. Years ago, and perhaps still today, when I had Shingles, many anti-virals were used to treat common sexually transmitted viruses.</p>
<p>While I had insurance through a state-run program, the list of approved medicine did <em>not</em> cover these anti-virals specifically because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted viruses. It was like the boards, likely mostly men, sitting around deciding what medication they deemed &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; for people to take should include methods to shame people when they acquired illnesses of &ldquo;ill repute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a young chronically ill person who had already been mistreated and gaslighted so much by the medical profession and now I faced paying $600 out of pocket for an anti-viral to protect my nerves and organs from damage. Is it any wonder I don&rsquo;t trust doctors and healthcare even to this day? They haven&rsquo;t gotten any better looking at how the pandemic is being handled. Depending on the calculator you use, $600 then is over $1100 today, and medication is far more expensive now. I have been seeing people with insurance coverage paying $900 out of pocket for Paxlovid.</p>
<p>My ME/CFS was also caused by a viral infection, likely Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV), the virus that causes Mononucleosis in the acute stage. Many people with Long Covid go on to qualify for the diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS. These post-viral illnesses all act similarly: an acute viral illness followed by some period of time and then another health trigger, either stress or another illness, often viral, that reactivates a virus-in-waiting in the body months or years later, launching the chronic illness stage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching this happen on repeat for so many years now I have started to see patterns. Following my anti-viral treatment for Shingles I entered a remission in my ME/CFS. No one at the time made any connection, and frankly neither did I. But now I have been reading studies and literature about Long Covid and additional related post-viral illness, and anti-virals can play a key role in these conditions.</p>

			 <p>I find myself wishing Micro.blog had the same thing for movies and TV as it does for books. Something for what you are watching, what you&rsquo;ve watched, a way to review it.</p>
<p>This thought brought about by just having watched <em>Brats</em> on Hulu, a documentary by Andrew McCarthy and what being a part of The Brat Pack was like. It was quite touching. McCarthy was always one of my favorite members of The Pack. I was struck by how much he reminded me of Matthew Perry in his personal capacity, not as the characters that he played.</p>
<p>I was sorry that Judd and Molly did not accept his repeated invitations to meet and talk. Emilio looks so much like his father now, it was like looking at President Bartlett. Anyway, worth a watch if you have Hulu and an hour and half of spare time to throw at it. Especially if you are GenX and those movies meant something to you.</p>

<p>As an equity-focused and values-driven organization, Evenings &amp; Weekends is committed to acknowledging the ongoing equity impacts of COVID. COVID is worse for some groups compared to others because of the systemic oppressions that we address in our work every day: racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and the exploitation and resulting precarity of low-income people.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge the reality that nobody is invincible. There is undeniable evidence that COVID is a full-body disease that damages our brains, hearts, blood vessels, lungs, and immune systems. Despite what we are told, COVID is not mild. The ‚ÄúS‚Äù in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, stands for ‚Äúsevere,‚Äù after all. The virus‚Äôs immediate impact may not feel extreme, but it‚Äôs not always possible to tell what damage our brains or blood vessels or immune systems have sustained until later.</p>
<p>Some people experience long-lasting symptoms after contracting COVID (Long COVID), which can include extreme fatigue, cognitive damage (‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), breathing difficulties, and organ damage. While some people improve, many do not; instead, they experience ongoing debilitating symptoms. The unmitigated spread of COVID, which is transmitted mainly through the air, has been described as one of the biggest mass-disabling events in history, and the oncoming impacts of Long COVID on society ‚Äúso large as to be unfathomable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, we‚Äôve designed a workplace COVID health and safety policy to help protect ourselves, our colleagues, and our clients.</p>

			 <p>Why do I allow myself to feel bad for feeling how I feel? I feel bad that I feel bad, but also that someone else might also feel bad that I feel bad. It&rsquo;s all bad. It&rsquo;s so bad that I just want to not feel bad and pretend I don&rsquo;t, when I do. I just need to process it for the time it takes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really tired tonight. I&rsquo;m in what we call a &ldquo;tired but wired&rdquo; phase pre-crash. My brain won&rsquo;t shut up but I&rsquo;m basically slobbering on myself from exhaustion. I&rsquo;m still feeling bad about the other stuff that has happened this week. I&rsquo;ve got so much to do before the weekend. The final step, it <em>better</em> be the final step, of the neighbor&rsquo;s tree falling on my garage is replacing the fence between their backyard and my driveway and garage. That&rsquo;s happening at the end of this week.</p>
<p>To prepare for this, I need to move some masonry blocks and some mulch. The mulch pile is left over from this spring when I had a very large load delivered. I spread it all but a couple wheelbarrow loads to top up areas that degrade faster from irrigation and that need topping up after planting or moving plants.</p>
<p>I think tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to vacuum my car. I left it out of the garage tonight so that after I&rsquo;m done vacuuming I can load up the wheelbarrow and move at least one load and then leave the rest in the wheelbarrow until the fence is done. That way I can get everything out of the way of the fence construction and nothing is on my driveway.</p>
<p>I think there is something in the idea of imposter syndrome that correlates to emotional invalidation. Like emotional invalidation leads to a personal imposter syndrome that prevents you from relying on and believing your own emotions and feelings. After reading the post I linked to and mentioned in my 100 Days of Blog post this morning, I thought more about it and how it mentions the long-term psychological damage that can cause a person subjected to emotional invalidation repeatedly or especially as a child to have issues acknowledging and working through their own emotions.</p>
<p>It makes me think about my time as a teenager when I was denied the validation for my illness for years. How my mother and I travelled all over trying to find out why I was sick. And how even after we had a diagnosis I was subjected to psychological harm via doctors continuing to treat me like it was in my head and that I brought it on myself. I start to cry <em>now</em> when I think about this, but I&rsquo;m also crying for myself today. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of trauma and for a long time I buried it and just tried to survive but I can&rsquo;t deny it anymore because it&rsquo;s just me. Nobody else is going to save me.</p>

			 <p>This garden status is dedicated to <em>finally</em> getting stuck into planting three of my new plants. This order of six plants from Annie&rsquo;s Annuals and Perennials came during the heatwave nearly two weeks ago and I&rsquo;ve been trying to get out to put the succulents in the ground but have been repeatedly delayed. Today, I did it!</p>
<p>Now, they won&rsquo;t look like much yet, but eventually the two put into the ground will be nice creeping groundcovers that bloom with little star flowers, as most succulents do. I decided to put the Mexican Snowball in a pot and set it in the garden, a style borrowed from my favorite succulent lady, Laura Eubanks of Design for Serenity. This will allow me to remove the pot from the garden during the rainiest part of the winter; although the echeveria is hardy in my zone, it will not survive cold <em>and</em> persistently wet conditions in slow draining soil, which I have with my SE Portland clay soil.</p>

			 <p>It has been a ridiculously long time since my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/31/some-day-notes.html">last note</a> and much has happened. Last time we were just wrapping up WeblogPoMo and I was planning on taking a relaxed June, but decided at the last minute to take part in <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/junited-2024">Junited 2024</a> and then I launched into posting on <a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a> for the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to Offload</a> challenge.</p>
<p>On top of many life events and incidents, stuff has not been very relaxing. But I know I got a lot done and I blogged about it so let&rsquo;s take a look at what I posted across my many blogs. Normally I organize these links chronologically regardless of blog. This time, since I&rsquo;m now posting regularly on so many, I&rsquo;m going to break it up into blog sections.</p>
<h3 id="apple-annies-weblog">Apple Annie&rsquo;s Weblog</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wrote a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/weblogpomo-2024-retrospective-communities-of-content">WeblogPoMo 2024 Retrospective: Communities of Content</a>.</li>
<li>I completed a very long interview. Long due my answers to the questions being long. The interview has not published yet, but when it does I&rsquo;ll be posting my own version on weblog.</li>
<li>I finally published a very long list of modern CSS that I&rsquo;m working on learning and brushing up my skills with: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/this-is-not-your-fathers-css">This is not your father&rsquo;s CSS.</a></li>

<h3 id="apple-annies-microblog">Apple Annie&rsquo;s Microblog</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/">Featured photos</a> continue and I&rsquo;ve switched my methods up again. Now I randomly go into my photo library via the Photos.app and delve into a year and month based on what the Photos app has placed as the &ldquo;photo&rdquo; for that month. It&rsquo;s working out well so far, and helps me see what was blooming or going on at the same time during that year.</li>
<li>My Garden Status posts were coming along until the heatwave hit:

<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/10/im-frustrated-here.html">I&rsquo;m frustrated here.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was quite a kerfuffle, which is putting it mildly, between several people working on Micro.blog and Adam of omg.lol over some behavior. I will not hash it out here again, but this entire situation has also left me feeling out of place on this platform since no accountability or recourse has happened for that behavior. In fact the entire situation was turned around on Adam, who did nothing but stand up for the marginalized person that was being attacked.</li>
<li>I watched the entire US King Kong franchise for the first time and posted quotes.</li>
<li>I watched some new (to me) TV shows and posted some quotes.</li>
<li>I posted quotes from people&rsquo;s blogs, social media posts, other articles on several subjects, including AI, tech, the web, chronic illness, health and sickness, and climate change and severe weather events.</li>
<li>You should probably just check out my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/quote/">Quote</a> category because there are too many to list here.</li>
<li>I posted other pictures from my garden:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/06/two-salvias-in.html">üå± Two salvias in opposing corners of the backyard.</a></li>

<li>I had several tough weeks.</li>
<li>I posted about starting a new challenge and finding a theme issue: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html">I started 100 Days to Offload challenge today.</a></li>
<li>I found meaning in a blog post to help me think through the previously mentioned kerfuffle: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/13/on-accountability.html">On Accountability</a></li>
<li>I watched season three of Bridgerton and crushed on Colin.</li>
<li>I posted more about AI: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/18/i-dont-want.html">I don&rsquo;t want attribution.</a></li>
<li>I found something I felt to be out of place on a Micro.blog theme and wrote about it: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/19/i-hope-i.html">I hope I word this okay.</a></li>
<li>I ordered and received some plants from Annie&rsquo;s Annuals and Perennials. I&rsquo;ve yet to get them in the ground due to the heatwave. Crossing my fingers to get it done this weekend.</li>
<li>I was grossed out by some content on a Youtube channel I&rsquo;ve subscribed to for quite a while and I&rsquo;ve stopped subscribing. When people show you who they are, believe them.</li>
<li>The debate was a turning point, nothing has gone well since, and I&rsquo;m glad I did not watch it: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/26/i-am-not.html">I am not interested in anything that comes from tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.</a></li>

<li>I sold one of my cars right before the heatwave hit and it was far more demoralizing that I expected and set me off poorly into what turned into a bad week during the heatwave.</li>
<li>I started reading a new book: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/06/currently-reading-the.html">Currently reading: The Viral Underclass by Steven W. Thrasher üìö</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="100-days-of-blog">100 Days of Blog</h3>
<p>I started the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to Offload</a> challenge and set up this blog to do the posting exclusively for the challenge. I used a contributed Micro.blog theme and did some minor customizations, mostly digging into Hugo template overrides and getting the posts to only show a summary on the paginated listing pages. I have posted <a href="https://100daysof.blog">twenty-six posts on this blog</a> for the challenge so far. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the format I chose, which is to sum up the previous day or days in a sort of &ldquo;day in the life.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m taking Sundays off, and occasionally other days as necessary. The cadence has not been too much so far.</p>
<h3 id="3x5pics">3x5.pics</h3>
<p>I am continuing posting a note every four days to 3x5.pics and I&rsquo;m still really loving this little site. I submitted it for a <a href="https://tinyawards.net/">Tiny Award</a> because I&rsquo;m really just so in love with it. I have no idea if it is the type of thing that this award goes for, but I thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot. Finalists will be announced July 19 and public voting will also open at that time.</p>
<h3 id="weblog-themescustomstyles">Weblog Themes/Custom/Styles</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make much progress on these sites during the last six weeks. In fact, the homepage of <a href="https://themes.lol">themes.lol</a> still shows my May 2024 status post, I need to get that updated within the next week, as I <em>have</em> made some progress working on <a href="https://custom.themes.lol">Custom</a> over just the last few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>I created a <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/definitions">Definitions</a> page for listing out all weblog templates and configuration settings.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/2024/07/customizing-a-weblog-homepage">a post on customizing a weblog homepage</a> and customized the Custom homepage at the same time.</li>
<li>I started a page on Shortcodes (aka &ldquo;tags&rdquo;) for weblog that I hope to have completed soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, I think it has been enough üòÖ Have a great week!</p>

			 <p>In complete honesty: I&rsquo;m concerned at the longevity of this platform. It does not feel like the actual stability and resolution of issues takes precedence over adding new shiny features. There does not appear to be enough support for reviewing help center posts. Downtime is noticeably a concern of mine now, at least seven or eight times this year so far, that I&rsquo;ve noticed. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure the pros outweigh the cons anymore.</p>
<p>Moving elsewhere was on my mind recently while writing answers to interview questions about my blog(s). I&rsquo;m not entirely sure where I want to go or if all blogs should move together. I&rsquo;d still like to see how Neato progresses, if it progresses. And with my health in limbo, I don&rsquo;t really have the bandwidth to do anything right away. I&rsquo;d most likely need to wait until this fall or winter.</p>
<p>And there is just the lack of &ldquo;community&rdquo; aspect that I have griped about before. I was never really here <em>for</em> the community, but if you&rsquo;re going to claim it as a feature, than you bloody well better maintain the community. I&rsquo;m not sure I buy the &ldquo;transition&rdquo; period excuse, as it seems it just isn&rsquo;t a priority. Making a community isn&rsquo;t a side gig you fit in when you have time. This feels similar to excuses by tech companies for their lack of ability to acquire and maintain diverse teams.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the AI stuff and a general feeling of &ldquo;ick&rdquo; I get from some of the proselytizing around here. I&rsquo;m not going to get into it deeply right now, there is plenty history on this blog of me talking about it. Every day we find out more about how this tech is a solution in search of a problem, spreading bad information, continuing to steal our intellectual property, causing harm to marginalized groups, and <em>above all else</em> contributing to the rampant climate change that leads to heatwaves like the one shredding my health right now. AI companies are Bad Actors who do not want to play by any rules. They want to run roughshod over nuance and wear us down with apathy. I don&rsquo;t want to be contributing to their businesses at all and even if I am not using the parts that have been integrated here, I feel extremely dirty and unsettled about it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve posted a few things about the heatwave in the US West in several places. On the omg.lol Discord I was met with jokes. Not jokes directly related to the heatwave, but jokes tangential to the information nonetheless. I&rsquo;ve found it hard to hang out there recently, which I&rsquo;ve mentioned before.</p>
<p>There really is something about Discord as a platform that seems to bring out the worst behavior in people. I don&rsquo;t see them acting this way in other places I encounter them. I really don&rsquo;t understand it, perhaps people are just stressed and need to let out off-hand comments without criticism. I guess I can relate to that, but there are plenty of other channels on the Discord to do that that don&rsquo;t immediately follow on information about a deadly heatwave.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd">Short Range Public Discussion on weather.gov</a> includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The staunch upper ridge in the western U.S. will sustain an intense, widespread and long duration heat wave for the West Coast. Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or broken with highs in the upper 90s to 110s likely up and down the West Coast and portions of the Great Basin. High temperatures soaring into the 110s this afternoon over the Central Valley of California are expected to be slightly lower for the next couple of days. These conditions remain extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously. The multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures will cause heat stress to build in people without adequate cooling and hydration. Excessive Heat Watches, Warnings and Heat Advisories are in effect for much of the West.</p>

			 <p>Some extremely scary trends related to the continued run of Covid-19, new strains, and research ties to both Long Covid and ME/CFS this week. You would do everything possible to prevent this from happening to yourself or someone you love if you truly understood what it is like to live this illness.</p>
<p>I have a hard time with so much these days. But top of the pile is the way society just throws our health away for some short-term idea of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;the economy.&rdquo; Several pieces I have read recently suggest that if we continue down this path <em>most</em> US adults will end up with some form of Long Covid, and believe me, there will be no economy when that happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Altogether, multiple pathways that deal with oxidative stress (glutathione, superoxide dismutase, lipid oxidative damage, etc.) appear to have been overwhelmed in the immune cells in both ME/CFS and long-COVID patients. In all cases, the ME/CFS patients were worse off than the long-COVID patients ‚Äì leading the authors to suggest that long COVID was an intermediate condition between health and ME/CFS.</p>

<p>Having spent a ground-breaking career studying the racialization, policing, and criminalization of HIV, Dr. Thrasher has come to understand a deeper truth at the heart of our society: that there are vast inequalities in who is able to survive viruses and that the ways in which viruses spread, kill, and take their toll are much more dependent on social structures than they are on biology alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would argue that COVID-19 is not a disease of the lungs at all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It seems most likely that it is what we call a vascular and neurologic infection, affecting both nerve endings and our cardiovascular system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that experts say SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äì the name of the virus that causes COVID-19 ‚Äì is complex, with many of its pathways just beginning to be understood. But some things are becoming clear. One of the best reviews of long COVID symptoms, Viswanathan said, appeared last January in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2">Nature Reviews Microbiology</a>. It detailed the disease&rsquo;s effects throughout the body, including the pancreas, blood vessels and reproductive system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SARS-CoV-2 is excellent at triggering your immune system to go from zero to 100,&rdquo; said Dr. Lindsay McAlpine, a neurologist who is director of the Yale NeuroCovid Clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. That revving of the immune response leads to both a &ldquo;wide swath of inflammation&rdquo; and excessive blood clotting, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the viral replication is going on in the lungs and nasopharynx (the area at the top of the throat that connects the nose to the respiratory system). But the inflammation that the virus triggers is systemic,&rdquo; McAlpine said.</p>

<p>These should be blue in my garden, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before. They should at least trend towards lavender since my soil is acidic. They were trending lavender last year. This year they are back to a blast of pink. I don&rsquo;t mind the pink, it really pops, but I do sort of wish the lavender or blue would make up its mind since this garden bed is supposed to be blues, lavenders, chartreuse, and yellow. Oh, well. They are still gorgeous.</p>

			 <p>I was authoring a post on <a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a>, and it said so right above the web editor (ie &ldquo;Post to your blog: 100daysof.blog&rdquo;) but after saving it showed up on this blog somehow. I don&rsquo;t really understand why that happened. I did navigate on another tab to a <code>micro.anniegreens.lol</code> admin page, but to have that change the currently in-progress blog post&rsquo;s target is a bit disconcerting.</p>
<p>So it seems there should be a way to move a post from one blog to another from within the edit form after a post is already published. In this case I had to delete the post from the incorrect blog, copying the content first, and re-creating it on the correct blog. I&rsquo;m not sure what the technical limitations of this ask would be, but it sure would be a useful improvement for premium accounts with multiple blogs.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve had this happen, where a post ends up on the wrong blog, either by my own accident or by whatever happened this time. But I could absolutely see it being a problem the more blogs I have. As I am only currently authoring on two blogs, but I have a third one in the works, it could get ugly.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just discovered even more weirdness with this! Whatever happened in the &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; of this piece of content in-progress from one blog to the other <em>added a new category</em> that was not previously here! This is some funkiness and I&rsquo;m considering filing something in the help center, though two of the last few things I&rsquo;ve posted have not gotten a single response, so I&rsquo;m not sure how much attention issues actually get there.</p>

			 <p>A debate is a tool used to figure out the differences between candidates and their stance on certain issues. There is nothing we don&rsquo;t know about Biden&rsquo;s take on the issues. There is also nothing we don&rsquo;t know about the insurrectionist&rsquo;s take. The only point of this debate is to make media outlets money and to push the shock and outrage machines to drive advertising dollars from: viewership of the actual debate and the fallout coverage afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty gross and obvious. I don&rsquo;t want any part of it and I&rsquo;m probably going to need to curb my ingestion of the news and internet over the next few days. Which is unfortunate because it is very likely an extremely important decision may come out of SCOTUS soon. It&rsquo;s almost like they know this and are hoping the media coverage is overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed but not surprised that CNN would choose to platform an insurrectionist and place him on the same stage as the current President of the United States even though the last time they were on the same stage, the insurrectionist was knowingly Covid positive. It&rsquo;s just disgusting.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a case of a few bad apples. It&rsquo;s a deep fucking rot metastasized through an entire orchard, fertilized by a pervasive belief among the tech elite that they&rsquo;re above the rules that govern the rest of us, that the sheer pixie dust swirling around their &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; means they can treat legislators like pests, competitors like roadkill, and users like livestock - just interchangeable resource nodes to be prodded, milked and eventually slaughtered.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t recall <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/14/nih-restructuring-proposed-by-top-congressional-republicans/">this piece in STAT</a> when it came out, but I&rsquo;m reading it now following feedback from a reader. Emphasis mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree with the authors that NIH needs reform. I was an athletic, otherwise healthy person who was struck down and disabled by long Covid in January 2022. For over two years, I‚Äôve watched life pass me by as NIH has fumbled the $1.15 billion allocated to it by Congress to study and treat long Covid. This initiative, known as RECOVER, has failed to publish any research that furthers our understanding of the underlying cause of long Covid and the vast majority of clinical trials they‚Äôve launched are for drugs that people have already tried and found unhelpful.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps NIH would not have bungled the long Covid funding had it not completely ignored other post viral diseases, namely myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) for the past 40 years. ME receives only $15 million a year ‚Äî the most underfunded disease per patient burden at the NIH.</strong></p>
<p>NIH should reevaluate how it allocates funding to diseases and base allocations on objective patient burdens. HIV, a disease with treatments that allow people with it to live mostly normal lives, receives $3.3 billion annually through NIH. <strong>Meanwhile, ME patients are disabled, have no approved treatments, and suffer a higher patient burden. Covid long haulers are suffering the same fate, many struck down as first wavers in March of 2020 are still disabled and sick as ever over four years later. Despite this, there is still no yearly allocation for long Covid in NIH‚Äôs baseline budget, as funding has only ever come from one time appropriations. NIH should right-size funding for ME and long Covid and start taking these diseases seriously.</strong></p>

			 <p>Today on one of my oldest YouTube subscriptions about Tiny Houses, the subject of the video was the downside of the tiny house movement.</p>
<p>It started out completely normal, mentioning legality and how slow moving regulations and protections have been in various locations. Then it moved into the rising costs which are mirrored in any type of construction and most consumer industries tied to inflation. But then it took a turn that I just cannot get behind.</p>
<p>It included a &ldquo;paid promotion&rdquo; badge, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bother me. Many of the channels I watch sometimes have paid promotional material, usually based on stuff they use or that is related to the subject of their videos. This, however, was not. It was a shilling for the silver and gold industry and I stopped the video right then and there and am even considering unsubscribing. Wow, how gross and unfortunate.</p>

			 <p>And I hope it doesn&rsquo;t come off sounding like I&rsquo;m unappreciative of the work that goes into Tiny Theme. I am very appreciative of it, and in fact, I reveal the attribution to the creator within the footer of my microblog, along with references to my customization.</p>
<p>However, today, while adding a new <code>head.html</code> template override in order to add a <code>&lt;meta name=&quot;color-scheme&quot; content=&quot;light dark&quot;&gt;</code> for passing through to an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> also using the same meta tag, I discovered that the Tiny Theme <code>head.html</code> adds a <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;author&quot; href=&quot;humans.txt&quot;&gt;</code> which functions to say that the author of the current document is what is in that <code>humans.txt</code>. That is, the creator of Tiny Theme.</p>
<p>While it is true that the <em>theme</em> was authored by this person, the <em>current document</em> was not. I do not think this is the appropriate use of the <code>rel=&quot;author&quot;</code> attribute, either via <code>link</code> or <code>meta</code> tags. I&rsquo;d venture to guess most people don&rsquo;t realize that is there.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#author">MDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>author</code></p>
<p>Indicates the referenced document provides further information about the author of the current document or article. Relevant for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>With <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>, it indicates the linked document (or mailto:) provides information about the author of the nearest <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> ancestor if there is one, otherwise the entire document.</p>
<p>With <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, it represents the author of the entire document.</p>

<p>Also, to believe that something can &ldquo;never go away&rdquo; or that anything lasts forever, along the lines of &ldquo;too big to fail,&rdquo; is simply rolling over and accepting waves of authoritarian bullying.</p>
<p>I am starting to find it untenable to remain on a platform that seems to be embracing this ethos. Especially when they simultaneously feel the need to place blame on someone asking for another person to be accountable for their words and actions that harmed someone with less power than them. It is not surprising when you think about these two scenarios being nearly the same thing: when a power dynamic is not in balance and support is given to side already with more power.</p>

			 <p>We are five days from the summer solstice. Today&rsquo;s sunset was at 9:01pm and next Thursday will be the latest sunset of the year at 9:02pm. I read today that the summer solstice in Portland is 6 hours and 59 minutes of daylight longer than the winter solstice. Nearly a whole new day of light within a single day. I&rsquo;m exhausted just thinking about it. I love what summer does to the garden, but I do get weary this time of year and dream just a little bit of a cooler and darker existence, when the rains come.</p>
<p>This update includes some random shots from the garden this morning. The back sun loving perennial border is coming into full bloom now. Finally, the Shasta daisies are opening, the two I have are double and full of frills. This buttery yellow one is so smooth and creamy I could plant it everywhere and not get tired of it. We had some rain today and the centers gathered the rainfall and a fly was taking a drink, I could not decide on a favorite so you get all three.</p>

<p>Along the top of the rockery, and to be honest <em>through</em> the rockery, the blue star creeper is&hellip;creeping. This plant is a thug and I have to tear bunches of it out every year but I just cannot tear it out completely. Not only because it would be so hard but because <em>look at it</em>, it creates this mounding cascade of blue pillows this time of year and is usually covered in bees. Please note: this was <em>one</em> four-inch nursery container when I planted it üëÄ‚Äîwatch out!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The back perennial border is mostly full of sun loving plants that flower from now until fall, with the exception of the far west corner that falls into shade against the west fence in the afternoon. But the vista of flower colors and foliage is always lovely and calming in the morning when they all see sun together.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A single container update, as this is turning into my favorite combination so far, purple + orange. I&rsquo;ve been calling this begonia orange creamsicle though I know that is not what it is called. The purple flower is a Jamesbrittenia hybrid and is performing far better than I imagined it would in its mostly shady location on the patio. Love the color of the flowers with orange center playing off the orange of the begonia. Gorgeous.</p>

			 <p>We had a bit of drama in an overlapping of two communities I am part of a couple weeks ago. I think it went by mostly unnoticed by the folks who were not affected or who did not involve themselves in the commenting/replies.</p>
<p><a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/the-gift-of-accountability/">This post by Mandy today</a> touches on something I think is important. Though the entire post is more about accountability in the sense of roles or positions at a job, she explains something about it that is absolutely relevant to how several people responded to what happened in our communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever participated in a blameless post-mortem, you‚Äôve already experienced that model of accountability. In a post-mortem, the aim is to unearth what happened‚Äîthe story‚Äîwithout passing judgment on or retaliating against any of the characters within it. The explicit freedom from retribution is what makes it possible for people to speak openly and honestly of an event. If I can speak candidly about how I fucked up, knowing no harm will come to me, I am more able to admit my mistakes, learn from them, and commit to making whatever repairs may be necessary to recover from the harm. Paradoxically, it‚Äôs the lack of blame that creates the possibilities of repair and insight, while the threat of punishment forecloses opportunities for both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the key line here is: &ldquo;The explicit freedom from retribution is what makes it possible for people to speak openly and honestly of an event.&rdquo; And unfortunately that did not happen in this case, because almost immediately &ldquo;one side&rdquo; started to call people names and act like a victim. The person on the other side who attempted to start a conversation and &ldquo;speak candidly about how [someone] fucked up&rdquo; was then made out to be the bad guy. So all good intentions and good will was out the door at that point.</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how this could have been made better. But Mandy&rsquo;s framing of accountability from an old definition of &ldquo;to render an account&rdquo; is a good place to start. How can we put our pitchforks down have rational discussions through stories? In fact, the actual harmed person did just that on their own blog, and they were still further attacked by the other side. It was rather shameful and I&rsquo;m sorry to have both witnessed the drama and for the person harmed. We can all do better by listening and learning before we speak or take action.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html">I started 100 Days to Offload challenge today.</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-10 16:43:18 -0700">Jun 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>These first few days will sort of be figuring out how I want to do this on <a href="https://100daysof.blog">100daysof.blog</a>. I&rsquo;ve started taking daily notes in the MB Notes feature. This may end up being a daily log. That might work well for this type of challenge, especially if I can pull off a 100-day streak. It&rsquo;ll definitely be all about posting the mundane day-to-day bits.</p>
<p>In the process I changed from the default Marfa theme to Alpine in order to shrink the header a bit. I don&rsquo;t want to be caught up in theming or styling on this blog because I&rsquo;d like to remain concentrated on the purpose: posting 100 times in the next year, ideally before the end of 2024, or even in the next 100 days.</p>
<p>This inevitably led me to need to tweak some things. Nothing huge but I ended up discovering that both Marfa and Alpine are styling some things based on an HTML <code>id</code> and that that <code>id</code> is being used on multiple elements in the document. This seems pretty basic to me as invalid HTML so I&rsquo;m sure it is an oversight.</p>
<p>I headed over to the Github repo for the Alpine theme but issues do not appear to be active, so I instead posted this as an issue on the Micro.blog help center. Hopefully that is the right place to put it. If I wanted to spend more time on it I could have fixed the issue myself but as I was saying, I purposefully am trying to avoid that with this blog. There will be plenty more opportunity for custom theming when I get started on Table for One Cafe.</p>

<p>Differences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Lawson Cypress &lsquo;Wissel&rsquo;s Saguaro&rsquo; tree has grown so much! this little tree will top out at eight feet tall and only two feed wide, perfect for my narrow side yard</li>
<li>the pink flowering shrub in the near distance was zapped in our 14¬∞F January cold snap so I divided my &lsquo;Moonshine&rsquo; yarrow from the back border and put part of it in that place; the pink will get picked up later in the season by a new aster nova which you can&rsquo;t quite see yet</li>

			 <p>These are the days of morning strolls in the garden to get pictures of the explosion in blooms before it gets too warm. The light is so much better in the morning and evening as well. The second salvia is elusive to photograph as after about 10am it is in too much sun to properly capture its essence. I have to time it just right so that it appears floating in a glowing fashion against the still-in-the-shade shrub behind it.</p>

I only publish posts to the timeline that use the category <code>timeline</code> because sometimes I don&rsquo;t want every post to hit the timeline. So now no posts are hitting the timeline.</p>
<p>Today I also noticed that, despite my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/29/discover-recently-has.html">recent complaint</a>, the Discover timeline continues to be a circle jerk of guys. It is 100% guys this morning. I&rsquo;m told it is in a transitional period, and that despite &ldquo;our best intentions&rdquo; it reflects the overall make-up of the Micro.blog userbase: guys.</p>
<p>You build community with intention, folks. Community, real community, does not happen by mistake or because you miraculously hit a sweet spot of hive minded individuals. That&rsquo;s not community. That&rsquo;s a cult. That&rsquo;s a hobby you spend two hours doing on the weekend with people you don&rsquo;t discuss the politics of your identity with because you might &ldquo;hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IT IS NOT HARD NOT TO BE A DICK. It is not hard to find interesting posts by interesting people <em>who do not look and think like you</em>. Discover, if I am not mistaken, is meant to be a place to discover new people that <em>other</em> people might be interested in following or finding new and different content to read. Discover <em>is not your timeline</em> or what you are interested in reading or following.</p>
<p>Please step out of your sheltered life and try just a little bit to see other people unlike yourself, especially male and white. By curating a timeline that looks like this you are not only harming those already here, but you are showing people not here who might be considering joining, what your values are. And if I wasn&rsquo;t already here I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be joining today based on the values I&rsquo;ve recently witnessed.</p>

			 <p>This garden status is exclusively about patio containers. I recently swapped out the pansies and violas for my summer combos <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/29/i-went-to.html">after loading up at the garden center this week</a>. It has been a few days so the annuals have settled in and a few have started blooming. I&rsquo;m even seeing foliage growth in just the two days since they&rsquo;ve been in the containers. Annuals are pretty amazing that way.</p>
<p>So think about these pictures as a &ldquo;before&rdquo; state. I have two experiments going on: I&rsquo;m relying on marigolds in the containers flanking either end of the patio, the ones that get more sun on the east and west ends. This will be interesting to see if it is enough sun for the marigolds to perform. I&rsquo;ve also planted some Jamesbrittenia (hybrid) in two containers that get either morning or afternoon sun for a couple hours. Very questionable whether it will be enough, so another test.</p>

			 <p>Holy crap, it&rsquo;s been a minute! Many things have happened and much time has passed. I am tired and preparing for a long relaxing weekend on the heels of WeblogPoMo 2024, but I realize I&rsquo;ve attempted to start a note for about a week and failed each time. It is now or never, let&rsquo;s do this!</p>
<p>We left off last time during the April Micro.blog photo challenge, I&rsquo;ll pick up where <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/24/some-day-notes.html">the last note ended</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished out the <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/challenge/">April photo challenge</a>, and in retrospect feel it to be a sweet sad thing as it may have been the last Micro.blog event with Jean at the helm, as she bids the team farewell to pursue other endeavors.</li>
<li>At the end of April, my neighbor&rsquo;s tree fell on my garage and set off a series of brain draining events. I dumped my thoughts into posts:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/26/stream-of-consciousness.html"><em>Stream of consciousness from Discord on a tree falling onto my garage.</em></a></li>

			 <p>After clearing out the pansies and violas that had been in my patio container since last October, I needed summer annuals and a few other garden products. I ended up spending $200 which hit me hard at the time. First, I&rsquo;m unemployed and chronically ill and every dollar I spend needs to be considered. Second, it seemed like a lot.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about many of the YouTube gardening channels I frequent and how many viewers respond or comment about the amount of money the channel owners spend on plants and infrastructure. I did a little math this morning and the plants themselves cost $130 of the $200, thirty-two plants at roughly $4 a piece (very simplified math). Many of the YouTubers respond to these comments on growing your own annuals from seed to save money, but this is also simplified math.</p>
<p>First of all, most people are already short on time. Accumulating the tools and infrastructure for growing things from seed is also an up-front cost that only pays off if you continue to do it every year. It also isn&rsquo;t really valuable in terms of time spent if you&rsquo;re only growing three dozen plants. Another way to save would be to propagate some of the plants at the end of the season and overwinter them indoors. Things like begonia and coleus propagate easily and can be quite happy house plants. But that also takes time and house plants can suffer from pests and disease.</p>
<p>As someone with an energy-limiting chronic illness, my time and energy is just as valuable to me as my money. If I were to view this as a trade-off between what I could charge as an hourly rate as a web developer, I&rsquo;d only be able to spend about an hour to an hour and a half caring for seedlings or propagations over the winter months to see the benefit. That is frankly unrealistic. I&rsquo;ve come out of this endeavor now feeling like the money was well spent. There&rsquo;s no shame in buying your annuals if the cost-benefit to grow your own does not work in your favor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be planting the patio containers up this afternoon or tomorrow, so of course I&rsquo;ll share some pictures when I&rsquo;m done!</p>

			 <p>What I find the most striking in this piece is her description of sizing up the risk with a million calculations on the spot. This is what many of us have to do to survive under patriarchy on a daily basis, but hearing it described by someone alone in the backcountry makes me really sad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be something he says. Maybe he makes a comment about my body or my appearance. Or he asks if I‚Äôm carrying a weapon and then presses for details about where I‚Äôm camping that night. Sometimes, it‚Äôs a shift in his tone, a leer, the way he puts his body in my space. But, usually, it‚Äôs a combination of things, a totality of behaviors that add up to a singular reality: this man is either not aware that he‚Äôs making me uncomfortable, or he doesn‚Äôt care. Either way, this is the danger zone. Even if he has no intention of harming me, the outcome of that intention is no longer possible for me to assess or predict.</p>
<p>In this moment, my mind snaps into a single, crystalline point of focus. My intuition rises to the surface of my skin. I become a creature of exquisite perception. The world is a matrix of emotional data: visceral, clear, direct.</p>
<p>I need to get away from the man. But I need to do it in a way that doesn‚Äôt anger him. This is the tricky bit. Men who lack social awareness or empathy often also lack other skills in emotional management. And usually, what men in these situations actually want is closeness. They‚Äôre trying to get closer to me, physically or emotionally, in the only way they know how. That combination of poor emotional skillsets and a desire to get closer is exactly what puts me in danger.</p>

I&rsquo;d love to see a disabled/chronic illness book sharing program, where you could become a member to share costs for physical copies and then ship them back and forth based on a calendar. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t scale well, but might be useful for a small group of readers.</p>

<p>We are in for another <em>fairly</em> warm day, though hopefully cooler than the last two (86¬∞-90¬∞F depending on your location in the metro). Though I am enjoying the increased sun on this area in the morning with the neighbor&rsquo;s tree gone, it is a woodland/shaded part of the garden falling under the magnolia tree and I far prefer the dappled shade and shadows during the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Plants in this view, from bottom to top:</p>
<ul>
<li>part of &lsquo;Seaview Sunset&rsquo; rhododendron, no longer blooming</li>
<li>a dwarf false solomon&rsquo;s seal ground cover</li>
<li>a dwarf hosta</li>
<li>a dwarf fern</li>
<li>Pacific bleeding heart</li>
<li>a hellebore, no longer blooming</li>
<li>three heucheras, a dark red-purple leaved one, a light peach-red leaved one, and a dwarf green-leaved one</li>
<li>a dianthus, not yet blooming</li>
<li>a dwarf geranium, not blooming, barely visible in this picture</li>
<li>a sword fern</li>
<li>the magnolia tree trunk</li>
<li>three azaleas, (mostly) no longer blooming</li>
<li>the bottom of a weeping white spruce</li>
<li>&lsquo;Czechmark Trilogy&rsquo; weigela in the back corner, blooming</li>

			 <p>The modern tech company or capitalistic enterprise is taking cues from fascism and dictators in how they introduce a small piece of controversy, like a testing of the waters. Wait for an &ldquo;overreaction&rdquo; by the masses/their audience/core users, wait for that to burnout and normalize, before flooding the zone with too much to fight or argue with all at once. This is the same way fascism causes burnout and complacency and feelings of helplessness, like there&rsquo;s nothing to be done to fight the thing.</p>

			 <p>This garden status may be a little premature, but I figure I&rsquo;d better get it in before the upcoming &ldquo;heatwave.&rdquo; We had a very pleasant April, but it was fairly dry, though not overly warm, just&hellip;pleasant. This may seem great but it meant that our normally wet spring hasn&rsquo;t really been so wet. Over the last week, the rain has returned and many of the &ldquo;May flowers&rdquo; are sitting with buds-in-waiting for some sunshine so they can do their thing.</p>
<p>It is currently Monday, May 6, 2024, and our forecast high in Portland is to be 57¬∞F. We&rsquo;ve had gray skies, rain, sun breaks, downpours, hail, and blue skies and sun, all just today. By Friday that high temperature will be 88¬∞F and many things in the garden, having just been doused with two inches of rain, will explode with the sudden temperature increase. Many other things that have had a prolonged and beautiful bloom this spring will begin to fade.</p>
<p>I just made a round in the garden and took some photos. Some things are not quite ready for prime time, I expect I will need to make an interim &ldquo;garden status&rdquo; post in a week or two to include some of the plants that really would like to be blooming already but are not.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are some things I found lovely today and in the past week.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From the bookmarked article below, a quote that sums up so much of what society gets wrong about disability. To me, I think it is a fundamental misapplication of the prefix &ldquo;dis-&rdquo; which means &ldquo;opposite of.&rdquo; But in words like &ldquo;disfunction&rdquo; the application is not &ldquo;does not function&rdquo; it is that it isn&rsquo;t functioning as expected or as desired. In my opinion, this should be the application of &ldquo;dis-&rdquo; in disability as well. Sometimes that simply means that the conditions are not met to create ability through no personal fault, often due to environmental or societal factors knowingly or unknowingly not creating the conditions for ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was very common for disability professionals to frame disability as related to either inability or ability ‚Äì focusing on what people cannot or can do. Many of these professionals thought that disabled people were discriminated against because of their inability to achieve things. This is problematic because it assumes that disabled people are lower in ability. It also assumes disability is all about if a person can achieve something. This is not only not true, it also individualizes disability, blaming the person for their situation, ignoring the many barriers that are placed in people‚Äôs ways.</p>

			 <p>My teenage years were pretty traumatic between finding out about having this terrible illness, being psychologized by doctors, and abandoned by friends and family, and treated terribly by my schools. And that was more than 30 years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a story that found me. In 2021, after writing about long Covid, I was accused by the psychiatrist Prof Michael Sharpe of spreading it. Apparently, you could induce such illnesses by discussing them. Investigating further, I was astonished by the failure in his presentation to support his claim with evidence, and perturbed by his lack of satisfactory answers to my questions. Sharpe takes a similarly ‚Äúbiopsychosocial‚Äù approach to ME/CFS, one which at the time of his long Covid presentation still dominated medical practice in the UK.</p>
<p>You can trace the origins of this model to a paper published in 1970. Without assessing a single patient or interviewing a single doctor, it blamed an earlier outbreak of post-viral ME/CFS on ‚Äúmass hysteria‚Äù based on case notes alone. The reasoning included the fact that the outbreak affected more women than men. For centuries, doctors have been readier to classify women‚Äôs illnesses as ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù or psychosomatic than they have men‚Äôs. ME/CFS, like long Covid, hits women harder, so, the thinking goes, it must be all in the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>We now know that patients were right to resist interventions that have proved to be both useless and harmful. The impacts were often horrific. A study in Switzerland found that the most powerful factor contributing to suicidal thoughts among people with ME/CFS was ‚Äúbeing told the disease was only psychosomatic‚Äù.</p>
<p>Some patients were forced into these treatment regimes, even locked in psychiatric units to make them comply. Some parents of children with ME/CFS were referred to social services for supposedly encouraging their belief that they were ill. Though unevidenced, the biopsychosocial model influenced the government‚Äôs social security policy, reinforcing its coercive treatment of people seeking disability benefits.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s little bright spot is complicated.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, before I&rsquo;d even made coffee or gotten out of my robe, I heard cracking. The sound of wood doing something it shouldn&rsquo;t. At first I looked outside in the direction I thought it was coming from and didn&rsquo;t see anything unusual. Or so I thought. We had a bunch of rain the day before and my neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree, freshly laden with leaves, did appear to be hanging a bit low in front of the garage, but not <em>too</em> low.</p>
<p>But the cracking continued. And the tree was falling. All day. Lower and lower. I went outside to try to assess what was going to happen with it, since the direct path of the fall was my garage. I had a pile of mulch in front of the garage, leftover from moving it around my yard, but directly in the way of getting the car out of the garage.</p>
<p>So, there in my robe, having had no coffee, I shoved half the mulch pile into the wheelbarrow and over to the side of the driveway, enough so that I could get the car out of the garage, a) before something terrible happened, or b) the tree branches blocked me from doing so. I managed to do both things still in my robe.</p>
<p>After that I concentrated on calling people: my neighbor, who I had not heard from and who I don&rsquo;t think was home, my homeowners insurance, unsure if I&rsquo;d need to make a claim, and several other neighbors to talk about the circumstances. The circumstances as they were that that tree should have come out ten years ago. I&rsquo;ve hated it since I bought this house. And apparently the neighbor knew it needed to come out and had had the tree service over <em>a week ago</em> to start the removal process.</p>
<p>In Portland if you want to do anything with a tree, you need a permit. Unless you are planting one on private property. But if you are removing one, you need a permit. If you are planting one in a right-of-way like the parking strip, you need a permit. It&rsquo;s a system that has lofty goals but rarely works to achieve those goals and most people hate the system. First of all, it is slow. Painfully slow.</p>
<p>So while the neighbor was waiting on a permit the tree went ahead and fell on my garage. Now, I don&rsquo;t know that they knew it was in danger of falling, but I do know that three days ago I was clearing the gutter on that side of the garage in preparation for the rain on Thursday, and I kept hitting my head on a branch <em>that didn&rsquo;t used to be there</em> so I suspect my neighbor knew something was happening and that the tree was already leaning. I did not recall this hitting-of-my-head until this morning when I was talking with the arborist.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about this tree. It is an apricot tree, and a very large old apricot tree, most likely planted back when this neighborhood used be full of empty lots and many vegetable gardens and fruit trees. My yard likely had a fruit tree too. And that house was built in the 50s the same time my garage was built, so it is likely that that apricot tree was in an empty lot. My house was built almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Apricot trees, like many stone fruit trees, like warm dry weather, they are not suited to Portland&rsquo;s climate for the most part. And that tree was never happy. Every spring it would barely bloom as we&rsquo;d get a late cold snap, and then it would try to leaf out only to be hit with a long wet spring and sporadically drop leaves, sprout more leaves, and drop leaves again. It would try to fruit, but it never succeeded, instead it dropped sappy orange goo onto my garage roof which would then dry and stick to the shingle&rsquo;s texture and rip it off. Then to top it all off, every fall it would drop all its leaves nearly at once, covering the entire east side of my garage roof, gutter, and the narrow space between the garage and neighbor&rsquo;s fence. So many leaves, so stinky, that it could fill my green compost bin three or four times.</p>
<p>I hate(d) that tree.</p>
<p>The neighbor was going to remove that tree. They had started the process of doing that and were planning on footing the bill. But as soon as the tree fell and endangered my property, I became responsible for part of it. This is bullshit. I looked high and low for the reasoning that I could tell them they needed to pay for the entire removal without luck. It is viewed as &ldquo;storm damage&rdquo; and if it hadn&rsquo;t damaged my garage would not even be covered by my insurance. Even with my insurance coverage I&rsquo;d still have to pay my $1000 deductible. I didn&rsquo;t know if the cost of all the removal + damage would even exceed that.</p>
<p>Friday proved fruitless (heh üòè) in getting an arborist to come out, but my neighbor was able to get the arborist that was going to remove the tree and that was waiting on the city for a permit to come out today, Saturday. In the meantime the tree dug in, so to speak, piercing my garage roof, denting my gutter, and falling lower and lower in front of the garage door. I was under the impression that my garage was holding the entire weight of that tree for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The arborist was very kind. He was actually the owner of a very popular tree service in Portland and did all the removal of the portion on my side himself, from the top of the roof. Another crew member hauled the branches away down my driveway. I ended up paying for the hourly service of two crew members, quoted $600-700 though I have yet to be invoiced. I imagine the bulk of the tree and trunk removal to be quite a bit more than that on my neighbors side, but again, it is their tree and they were planning on removing it anyway. I am bit perturbed by this fact and that they didn&rsquo;t offer to cover the entire cost. It is frankly a bitch move and not very neighborly.</p>
<p>We ended up being very lucky. The damage to the garage is minimal in the end: two roof shingles and a dented gutter; my neighbor&rsquo;s fence has some snapped off slats but it was in need of repair anyway. Two things were working in our favor: on my neighbor&rsquo;s side a 2x4 piece of lumber in part of their kid&rsquo;s play set was holding up part of the tree&rsquo;s weight; on my side, a 4x4 concrete-filled steel post used by a gate (overkill much?) was holding up another part of the tree&rsquo;s weight. It could have been far worse. But I&rsquo;m still under the deductible so I&rsquo;m footing all of this work and damage.</p>
<p>So, you are asking, how is this a little bright spot, Anne? I&rsquo;m doing a lot of complaining.</p>
<p>Well, what if I told you someone came to me months ago and said: for roughly $600 we will remove that tree that you hate so much? You will never have to clean its mess up again <em>and</em> an abundance of light would flood into your backyard making you able to possibly grow vegetables again! Yes! I would absolutely do that! I would pay $600 to never deal with that tree again!</p>

<ul>
<li>my neighbor&rsquo;s tree has fall on my garage</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hated that tree for ten years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and this is its revenge on me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the funnest part of all of this? getting to decide who pays! so far my insurance says it is my neighbor&rsquo;s liability and my neighbor says the tree company says I have to pay!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and all of this could have been prevented if I didn&rsquo;t live in Portland where you have to get a permit to remove a tree, something that apparently my neighbor was already in the process of, and now the tree has gone ahead and fallen down while waiting on the damn city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so maybe the the city should pay?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me this morning in my robe before I even had coffee: moving a mulch pile so I coud back a car out of the garage in case the damage got worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that little car has the best turning radius, I managed to squeak it out of the garage and along the house with just about an inch or two of space to spare, I had to get out of the passenger side door</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tree is still falling, every once in a while I hear another crack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and apparently there are zero tree crews on a Friday so nothing can be done about this until tomorrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m living in a world where nothing makes sense</p>

<li>
<p>okay, I am moving this entire thought thread to my microblog</p>

			 <p>It is high time for <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/06/some-day-notes.html">another note</a>! I&rsquo;ve made it under a month this time, such an accomplishment. I particularly feel like I need to get this done now, before April ends and May begins, because I will be busy in May, and I&rsquo;ll explain a bit about that at the end of this note.</p>
<p>The last three weeks have seen me in the garden a lot. I&rsquo;ve had tasks to complete and the rest of the mulch to spread and I&rsquo;m back on a weekly mowing schedule, so it is definitely The Season again. I&rsquo;ve also been busy with more <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/projects">web projects</a> and tinkering and am about to jump into another one in May, though a couple of them are just sitting on the back burner for now while I am occupied by other things.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into it!</p>
<ul>
<li>On the same day I posted my last note, I published <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/what-ive-learned-about-css-color-scheme-and-system-color"><em>What I&rsquo;ve learned about CSS <code>color-scheme</code> and friends.</em></a> and was surprised and delighted by the positive reactions to it. Nothing is a better cure for imposter syndrome than writing something slightly technical and getting good feedback from a mostly technical audience. I really love this &ldquo;format&rdquo; of writing: diving into a topic, making a tangible example/use case, and blogging about it‚ÄîI would do nothing but this if I could!</li>
<li>I am continuing the April photo blogging <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/challenge/">challenge</a> on Micro.blog and doing better this time with not beating myself up over diving into my photo library for many of the pictures. I&rsquo;ve taken some new ones, but 80% of the entries are probably from the archive.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to be better about writing more openly about the different parts of me. <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/owning-your-content-is-owning-yourself"><em>Owning your content is owning yourself.</em></a></li>
<li>On the heals of buying <code>tableforone.cafe</code> I wrote about one of the ideas I have for it: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/my-grandmothers-recipe-box"><em>My grandmother&rsquo;s recipe box.</em></a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/11/garden-status-it.html"><em>Garden Status (2024/04/11)</em></a> post, which is a series I&rsquo;m trying to keep up on, if not intermittently. This is the time of year for it, though it might be nice to continue with it year round because the garden never truly sleeps.</li>
<li><a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/blogroll-spin-4"><em>Blogroll Spin #4</em></a> is in the books and with it more omg.lol members join the list üòÖ</li>
<li>My long-awaited <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblog-publishing-workflow"><em>Weblog Publishing Workflow</em></a> is finally finished and published. This took so long to do and caused me a lot of anguish, partly because I didn&rsquo;t want to miss anything and partly because it is a bit of exposure into how I&rsquo;m doing things unconventionally and I didn&rsquo;t want to be judged. But we can&rsquo;t get through life without being judged so I pulled off the bandage and bared my wounds! Really, it turned out pretty great, and I&rsquo;ve gotten lovely feedback on it as well. Thanks to all those who have told me they liked it! I think my takeaway from the experience and feedback is that there truly is no right way to get your content onto the web and that is really part of the beauty of it üíú</li>
<li>100th weblog post! Fittingly, the <em>Weblog Publishing Workflow</em> post was my 100th weblog post. Thinking about getting all these posts into the last ~15 months has made me eye a goal: completing the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> blogging challenge some time in the next year! And that had me acquiring <em>another</em> new domain: <code>100daysof.blog</code> which will also be a Micro.blog blog. Both this and <code>tableforone.cafe</code> are sitting idle because I have too many things going on at once right now (why do we do this to ourselves?)</li>
<li>I read and listened to many chronic illness and health-related things:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/12/this-could-be.html">This could be a big deal for people like me&hellip;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/it-is-impossible.html">It is impossible to read this and square it with&hellip;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/21/put-a-hold.html">Put a hold on this book on Libby&hellip;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been using a web component on my weblog (and <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component">wrote about it</a> in February) for embedding a Mastodon post, retrieving interactions for the post, and prompting more interaction. The author of that component recently created another that I&rsquo;m now using on my microblog, in combination with EchoFeed, and I&rsquo;m really liking how it is working out. <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/adding-link-previews-to-echoes-on-my-microblog"><em>Adding link previews to echoes on my microblog.</em></a></li>
<li>Of course I had some AI-related opinions:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/16/the-publicly-on.html">The &ldquo;publicly on the web&rdquo; excuse for AI is malarkey.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/17/your-ai-isnt.html">Your AI isn&rsquo;t making my life better.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/19/its-just-the.html">It&rsquo;s just the same boring playbook&hellip;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/19/this-period-is.html">This period is the great dumbing down.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the tails of my <code>color-scheme</code> post, and in pursuit of extending this knowledge and usefulness, I pursued an idea I had been toying with and which I saw some discussion of on Mastodon. I&rsquo;m starting with themes.lol using <code>color-mix()</code> with the <code>accent-color</code> used on some form controls with system colors to get a &ldquo;hue&rdquo; in both light and dark modes. I&rsquo;m still working on this, and want to implement it elsewhere, but will definitely have a post on it at some point, likely during the upcoming blogging challenge.</li>
<li>I wrote some more about my garden: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/i-have-a.html"><em>I have a yard. No, I have a garden.</em></a></li>
<li>And more: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/the-gentians-are.html"><em>The gentians are in their prime.</em></a></li>
<li>And even more: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/here-is-the.html"><em>Here is the result of my hard work this week.</em></a></li>
<li>We all need a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/20/little-bright-spot.html">üîÜ Little bright spot</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, the <em>biggest news of this note</em>: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024">WeblogPoMo 2024</a>! This will occupy my time and concentration for the month of May so that is why many other projects may sit idle or see very little progress for at least another month. But I do foresee some of the things I&rsquo;ll be blogging about making their way into already active projects, such as themes.lol and even weblog proper.</li>
<li>I expand a bit on this new blogging challenge in a post: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblogpomo-2024-and-tiny-pages"><em>WeblogPoMo 2024 and tiny pages.</em></a></li>
<li>I purchased yet another omg.lol address, üçè, and with it I plan to set up my &ldquo;tiny pages&rdquo; to use for CSS experiments during WeblogPoMo.</li>
<li>JS Naked Day (today) made me have thoughts: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/23/excuse-me-while.html">Excuse me while I beleaguer a point.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That is probably all for now. As WeblogPoMo will absorb all my brain resources for the next month, I may not have a new note until it ends. Have a great week and see you in June!</p>

			 <p>We are entering JS Naked Day! We just got through CSS Naked Day a week or so ago! These are great days, and I think the point of them might be getting lost&hellip;or at least the point I always got from them: here&rsquo;s how a site looks, works, <em>and breaks</em> without some of the tools of the web.</p>
<p>It is not only a way to show how well your site works without these tools, but as a cautious tale of how your site breaks without these tools and to provide a lesson perhaps to yourself and others! I want to see these things and I want them to provide guidance on what to do better.</p>
<p>The scramble to perfect the flaws in the days leading up to the so-called Naked Days I think masks the lessons we should be learning. What if instead we bared these imperfections and wrote about it? Maybe put up a caveat on your home page saying &ldquo;look, I can do better, maybe you can too&rdquo; because this might be one day for you and me, but some people for one reason or another experience the web every day without these tools.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t sound like I&rsquo;m preaching from an ivory tower, as I did not participate in either this year, though I do plan to in the future. I absolutely appreciate those who do, even when they scramble to fix bugs. But I&rsquo;d also love to see what we&rsquo;ve taken for granted and how we can work to make the web better through these little revelatory exposures.</p>

			 <p>I admit these aren&rsquo;t the <em>best</em> photos but they are probably the first photos I&rsquo;ve taken from my kitchen window &ldquo;bird blind&rdquo; that even remotely turned out. I am zoomed as far as my little Canon S90 (a circa 2010 camera that still works!) would go.</p>
<p>This lovely white-crowned sparrow is <em>still</em> here! C&rsquo;mon little cutie, it is high time to move on to your breeding grounds up north! Not that I mind you being around at all (I&rsquo;ve actually not heard their song in a week or so&hellip;)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how to frame this time period we are in. A time after a great wave of illness. Indeed we are still in that great wave, even if you aren&rsquo;t hearing about it from your government or on the news. This is step one.</p>
<p>And then with step two we have this &ldquo;magic tool&rdquo; that has been sold to so many as a panacea of knowledge, a way to level the field. Except its effect will have the exact opposite result. It will not level the field but increase disparity.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t replace menial jobs, it won&rsquo;t create high quality, high paying, high reward employment for folks. No, menial jobs will only increase, and with them the need to work more of them. Hard and unforgiving jobs. Jobs that make you scrape the barrel.</p>
<p>And that is step three. When your needs aren&rsquo;t met, you can&rsquo;t think critically. You don&rsquo;t see big pictures, you see what is in front of you to get you to whatever is the next thing.</p>

			 <p>And why I am pretty much laid up today. Two years ago, I removed the grass behind the berm from just beyond where it ended near the new basalt rock pathway from the sideyard to the patio. That was such a success that I decided to finish removing the remaining strip this year to round out the lawn in the backyard and be completely rid of narrow grass paths.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This section proved much harder the strip behind the berm, I think due to the proximity to trees and roots. I removed the sod in four strips, two strips a day for two days. And then on the third day I had my neighbor bring me a few wheelbarrows of top soil the he&rsquo;d removed from his front yard to put in some drains and rock paths. It was a perfect situation. Finally, I topped the soil with four wheelbarrows of mulch and tamped it down. This turned out exactly as I had hoped it would, and now the path from the grass and around the berm in what I call &ldquo;the woodland&rdquo; is complete.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways this is the continuation of that project I started two years ago, after the completion of a basalt stepping stone path in the sideyard. I don&rsquo;t publish to Substack anymore, but you can read about that project here: <a href="https://anniegreens.substack.com/p/behind-the-berm">Behind the Berm</a>.</p>

Once my sister was weeding as a chore and accidentally dug some of them up and threw them out (they were not in bloom). My mom had a bit of a fit about it.</p>
<p>I suppose I&rsquo;d do the same. These are in my front yard terraces, the top terrace next to the lawn. The bottom terrace is next to the sidewalk and anyone walking by is about eye-level to these intense blue blooms.</p>

			 <p>You might notice I talk or post about it a bit. I share photos. I am proud of my garden. Every single plant in it I put there. What used to be empty terraces in the front and lawn all around, is now a mature and varied garden with interesting microclimates and &ldquo;rooms&rdquo;. This took thought, patience, and dedication.</p>
<p>Gardens need places for the eye to rest. Moments of silence in the physical landscape. Sometimes this takes shape with a lawn. People hate lawns because they use water and chemicals. But lawns still provide a purpose and if used in moderation I still feel have their place in the garden.</p>
<p>In my garden there are only two small areas of lawn remaining. I removed all of the rest of the lawn, approximately 2/3rds of the total lawn that used to make up my yard is now landscaped garden beds designed by me. But that remaining lawn does require irrigation. Had there not already been lawn and irrigation here when I bought this house, it is likely there never would have been.</p>
<p>In the city of Portland you are required to maintain an irrigation system. This might or might not mean you hire someone to do that. But at a minimum someone licensed to do so must perform a backflow test, and this usually coincides with the spring startup of the system. For me this occurred on Tuesday this week, and I had the guy perform a couple tweaks to my system.</p>
<p>One of those tweaks was to the controller. Six or so years ago I had a weather system put in that is connected to my irrigation controller. It is just a little device that collects rain water and tips it out when it gets to a certain point, takes temperature readings, etc. and stores all of that data in the controller and tells it when the different zones of my garden need water.</p>
<p>I have four zones, only two of them are lawn, the two areas mentioned above. The remaining two are drip for some of the newer areas of garden beds where I provide drip emitters directly to a plant&rsquo;s roots. Now you may be wondering why I am telling this backstory about my yard, garden, irrigation, lawn, etc. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>My neighborhood has a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; raccoon population. I&rsquo;ve witnessed entire families traveling through my yard. I&rsquo;ve seen momma&rsquo;s with five kits scaling a fence. I&rsquo;ve see a momma with a single kit in the middle of the day! But mostly I see the aftermath of raccoons in my yard. And of that aftermath is what happens during the summer when it is hot and the irrigation runs late at night/in the middle of the night and the raccoons decide to have a party.</p>
<p>It is not a pretty sight. It is a mess. They damage plants, they dig holes, they cause mayhem. Last year when the irrigation guy came out I asked them to change the controller to run the irrigation in the morning not at night because of the raccoons. I watched the guy get into the controller and seemingly perform the modifications for this request. However, it was not really fixed. I attempted again, I had tried before, to navigate this controllers settings and menus, and alas dear reader, this system is too complicated for me, an unusual thing to admit.</p>
<p>So last year I got up every day during the summer that I ran the irrigation (not every day) at 5am and manually ran it to avoid the Rowdy Raccoon Rave in the garden. I did this for four long months, basically May-September. It wasn&rsquo;t fun, but I didn&rsquo;t feel like calling the irrigation guy back, which would have incurred a charge and I just wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to tell this guy that he did his job wrong.</p>
<p>This year it was a different guy and he fully admitted the controller is far more complicated than it needs to be, that even he had a hard time figuring it out, and that he tried to make the changes but was unsure, and that if I have issues or it isn&rsquo;t running when I want it to to call him back. He even said he might have to send his supervisor to figure the controller out. I have to tell you I feel so much better about myself after that conversation. And last night, well, this morning, guess what? <em>The system ran at the right time!</em> I was making coffee and it started at 5:15am just like he said it would! I am elated, you don&rsquo;t understand, this is so great.</p>

			 <p>This tree is yet another of my Japanese Maple survivors. I started a draft on Substack when I was still writing there in 2022 about my other survivor and never finished it. Maybe I should move it here.</p>
<p>I nearly killed this tree last year when I took a hose from the driveway to water it. The hose had been laying on the concrete all morning and picked up solar gain, superheating the water inside. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking and almost immediately realized what I had done but it was too late.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few days to weeks, the tree lost nearly all its leaves, but later pushed out new growth into the summer. I didn&rsquo;t know what was truly dead so I waited for it to bud out this spring and pruned off everything that had no signs of growth. I lost about half the canopy. But it lived. It has the most spectacular fall color.</p>

			 <p>It has been about a month, maybe a little less, since the last Garden Status and we&rsquo;re getting into the thick of spring. Everything is popping! I grabbed some photos this week, so here&rsquo;s a slew!</p>
<p>There are three aubrietas in the front yard terraces and next to retaining walls that are as lovely as can be this year. The candy tuft (not pictured) is also more full of blooms than I can remember in years past. My neighbor tells me these plants really like a good long vernal period and we haven&rsquo;t been having those much in recent years (probably due to climate change), but this year&rsquo;s deep intense 14-15¬∞F freeze in January must have done the trick for them.</p>

<p>There is no end to the joy the pansies, violas, and primroses, bring me each fall/winter/spring. If my climate allowed, I&rsquo;d grow them all year. But in about a month, the temperatures will not longer be conducive to them thriving and I&rsquo;ll be swapping them out for heat-loving summer annuals. Enjoy them while you can!</p>

<p>The Deshojo Japanes Maple tree on the patio is fantastic this year. It&rsquo;s had a rough couple years, and I considered it being time to move it out of the container and into the ground. Unfortunately this would not happen in my garden because: a) I don&rsquo;t have the room for another tree in my garden, and b) I have had a Japanese maple succumb to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verticillium_wilt">Verticillium wilt</a> in my garden, and other than the two Bloodgoods in the parking strip, which are quite mature and not showing any signs yet, I don&rsquo;t want to take the chance on any others. I lost a Crimson Queen and it crushed me. So, when this tree needs to get out of its container, it will leave my garden and end up elsewhere.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This tree will transition the leaves to all-green by summer time, and then back to a rainbow of hues and brilliant reds and oranges in the fall. This bright pinky-red color only lasts for a brief fleeting moment in the spring. It really is one of the best Japanese maples for color changing leaves.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The common name of this plant is &ldquo;bog rosemary&rdquo; but it isn&rsquo;t a rosemary, and it isn&rsquo;t even closely related to rosemary. Bog rosemary is more closely related to ericaceous evergreen shrubs such as huckleberry, blueberry, and cranberry. The name comes from the rosemary-esque leaves, though upon closer inspection they resemble tiny rhododendron leaves, also a relative, and its tolerance and preference for boggy growing conditions‚Äîdon&rsquo;t let it dry out!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t often post pictures of the weeping white spruce (Picea Glauca &lsquo;Pendula&rsquo;) because it is sandwiched between two other trees and hard to get on its own. It usually is included in more expansive pictures of my entire backyard. But this year the tree is producing cones! Little red cones, oodles of them at the top of the tree, though I see signs of them farther down, so I&rsquo;ll need to get some pictures of them too once they develop. I got up on a ladder to get these pictures üòÅ</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the final set of pictures are of a narrow upright crabapple in the back corner of my yard called &lsquo;Marilee&rsquo;. This sweet little tree produces the most adorable bright pink buds followed by classic pinky-white apple blossoms with yellow starburst centers. And they cover the branches in what appear like sleeves of blossoms.</p>

			 <p>A month has gone by since <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/09/some-day-notes.html">my last note</a>‚Äîwhere did the time go?! Much of it has been spent struggling internally over how to spend my time: web tinkering or gardening. Since spring is well upon us in western Oregon, I have a lot to do on both fronts.</p>
<p>We avoided a late freeze this year so the magnolia tree has been in one of the most abundant and log-lasting blooms (super bloom?) of any year since I planted it more than ten years ago. Over the past week I&rsquo;ve been mulching the garden, a little bit at a time. I&rsquo;m about 2/3rds done, but most of the work will be in the backyard where I need to rake up some magnolia petals in the rockery before spreading mulch and I&rsquo;ll be removing some sod in the back corner of the garden to round out the lawn. I&rsquo;m planning on using some of the sod to fill a few holes elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the web, I am keeping up a good cadence with blog posts, both here on Micro.blog and on weblog. I&rsquo;m still working on <a href="https://themes.lol">themes.lol</a> regularly and keeping the homepage set to show the most recent updates. On <a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a> a new index card is published every four days. I purchased a new domain (tableforone.cafe) and plan to use a second microblog and custom theme for it. But first, I want to get an initial release of my styles on themes.lol wrapped.</p>
<p>Enough of the preamble, onward!</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve carried on with my featured photos but noted a change to how I curate them in <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/11/the-featured-photos.html">a post</a>.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/11/a-response-to.html">a small response</a> to a piece published by NPR regarding continued vigilance by chronically ill and vulnerable folks.</li>
<li>We got an awesome new feature on Micro.blog to create a blogroll (&ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;) and <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/12/im-not-going.html">I had a reaction to the makeup</a> of a lot of what I was seeing, both here and other places.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/13/i-made-a.html">I made a soup!</a></li>
<li>I published a &ldquo;case study&rdquo; (in quotes as I hadn&rsquo;t necessarily considered it that way until it was featured in <a href="https://blog.kizu.dev/recent-css-bookmarks-015/">Roma&rsquo;s fantastic CSS bookmarks</a> and called that) on <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/creating-3x5-pics">creating 3x5.pics</a> where I go more into the technical decisions of the design.</li>
<li>On weblog, <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/15/i-created-a.html">I made a &ldquo;featured post&rdquo; component</a>.</li>
<li>We hit a milestone with the pandemic (yes, it is ongoing) and my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/15/todays-featured-photo.html">featured photo that day</a> included some reminiscing.</li>
<li>The aforementioned <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/16/todays-featured-photo.html">magnolia super bloom</a>.</li>
<li>I started another series on <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/18/garden-status.html">garden status</a>, where I plan to give frequent updates with photos on how my garden is doing throughout the seasons and years. This might include projects and may eventually morph into resuming my newsletter‚Äîwe shall see!</li>
<li>I joined the <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/22/joined-the-indieweb.html">IndieWeb webring on this microblog</a>, the first I&rsquo;ve joined here. I have <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/webrings">several on weblog</a>, and I&rsquo;d like to join more!</li>
<li>The <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/blogroll-spin-3">blogroll on weblog took its third spin</a> and I included information about incorporating my microblog into this ritual.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/23/opinion-request-if.html">thinking about cross-posting</a>, I still haven&rsquo;t set anything up. I think I will have better momentum on this soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/and-i-have.html">I discovered thehtml.review</a>.</li>
<li>I tried to <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/little-bright-spot.html">keep up</a> with my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/31/little-bright-spot.html">Little bright spot</a> series.</li>
<li>The Fediverse had another set of rough days where the topic of Threads and Meta dominated. I have many reactions, ranging from disgust to sadness:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/sigh-i-just.html">Sigh. I just have zero trust in any goodwill from this company ever.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/27/im-taking-a.html">I&rsquo;m taking a small media break.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I made <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/about-page-updates.html">meaningful updates</a> to my microblog <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/about">About page</a>.</li>
<li>I wrote about <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/rough-start-to.html">various points of progress</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying out a new &ldquo;share&rdquo; component on weblog. I really like the idea behind this and <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/29/im-testing-this.html">wrote a small blurb</a> as well as linked to the post by the author of the component.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/my-me-life.html">another part to My ME Life series</a>. This time I jump forward quite a bit in time, but this may be how this series goes.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/31/im-doing-it.html">Discord is taking too much of my attention when I should be blogging!</a></li>
<li>I am <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/01/i-cant-fall.html">regularly listening to Pandora again</a>, my many well-curated stations are like tried-and-true old friends. I also added a &ldquo;listening to&rdquo; section to my <a href="https://now.anniegreens.lol">/now page</a>.</li>
<li>I added <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/01/im-compiling-a.html">a new page to weblog called &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;</a> and, no, <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/02/i-realized-last.html">not the same recommendations as what Micro.blog calls blogrolls</a>.</li>
<li>Aaaand we&rsquo;re on a new <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/challenge/">photo challenge</a> and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it!</li>
<li>I get <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/03/i-am-on.html">a little upset sometimes about folks not providing alt text for images</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll do it for now. Hopefully I will not let another month go by before publishing another note.</p>
<p>Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m prepared not to get one. I&rsquo;m prepared not to be satisfied by the ones that I get. But I&rsquo;ve been bothered by this thing long enough now I&rsquo;m asking it.</p>
<p>If you share photos anywhere: on Mastodon/Pixelfed/etc, on your own website, on some other public platform where other people have access to it, and you don&rsquo;t add alt text for images, why?</p>
<p>I really cannot understand the lack of empathy behind it. I&rsquo;ve heard every manner of excuse, including the sometimes draining effects for people with cognitive or other limiting factors from writing the text. I actually have those factors. Part of my illness is cognitive limitations and I have to be mindful of them when I decide to take something on. If I don&rsquo;t think I can complete the thing with the necessary requirements, I don&rsquo;t undertake the thing. That includes posting a photo. I will put it off if I can&rsquo;t add alt text for other people <em>who also have limiting factors</em>.</p>
<p>My consternation at the lack of alt text I encounter day-to-day is most disturbing when it is done by someone who absolutely knows better: an author who writes about typography! It is such a jolt to witness, a dichotomy that makes me never want to purchase anything he creates. I find it so sad and bizarre and I can&rsquo;t come up with a meaning other than apathy.</p>
<p>If you have another reason, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. If you try to add alt text but sometimes forget or fail, I&rsquo;d love to know. I need some faith in humanity restored here.</p>

			 <p>This will supplement my <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/manual-of-me">Manual of Me</a>, but mostly I just want to get all this praise in a place I own and off of LinkedIn. And re-reading several of these from when I left my last job is sort of making me tear up a little bit. The people I worked with were so great, it was the &ldquo;job&rdquo; that was crap.</p>
<p>Still to this day, my most favorite developer in the world is a guy named Mike V., shucks I miss him. We were on three projects in a row and could communicate without even talking. LOL</p>
<p>He was a man of few words, if you know the kind. But he wrote me an email at the end that was full of words and told me I taught him a lot about front-end and design systems. Totally a back-end/infra type of developer, so that was some major kindness.</p>
<p>I wonder where those emails got put&hellip;I think I exported stuff to somewhere.</p>

			 <p>Specifically, my Tycho Radio station, a station that I began curating in 2009 when I first subscribed to Pandora. This station is so thoroughly me that there is <em>never</em> a song I don&rsquo;t approve. It&rsquo;s frankly shocking. But besides that, every song evokes something I can&rsquo;t quite describe.</p>
<p>Because the station has been with me for so long I feel movement when I listen to it. It is like longing, but also yearning. It feels like a personal station of songs just for me. I think a lot the songs surface memories from all the times I&rsquo;ve heard them. I know this happens to a lot of people with albums. But of course there are multiple artists and multiple albums.</p>
<p>The station was created right after a painful break with a boyfriend that sort of tore me apart. So there was a lot of finding myself involved in this station. One of the best songs that is representative of the station is Ti√´sto <em>Ten Seconds Before Sunrise</em>. The station begs a new beginning and makes me want to try.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m posting long rambling thoughts on spaces other than my own. What a hard habit to break.</p>
<p>Olu writes really good stuff on behavior in the digital age, and this most recent question is so interesting to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Especially her follow up, where she says almost her entire dating life has been online. I would say it is an age thing, but I don&rsquo;t think it is. Maybe it is personality or life experience, but I would say my dating experience is the literal opposite, I&rsquo;ve never taken online dating seriously. This might be a trust thing on my part.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should answer her if you have opinions!</p>
<p>Someone else follows up saying something about algorithms, and yes, that&rsquo;s one of my issues.</p>
<p>This is a weird comparison, but I feel very similarly about online dating as I do about weight loss programs. At one of my first jobs, Jenny Craig was a client. At my last company, Weight Watchers was a client. So I&rsquo;ve see things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since the first actual post in this series, <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/my-me-life.html">&ldquo;some early childhood&rdquo;</a>, my brain went to my last job. So, I&rsquo;m obviously jumping around quite a bit. I think there are several reasons for this. Nothing is a straight line, and most definitely not in my life. I think some parts of my life have had larger influences on the whole, and then of course there are contemporary events that make me think back to certain periods. My last job is one of them, as I&rsquo;m still reeling from that time period.</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> working at what was supposed to be my dream job. I had left the job prior to that feeling dissatisfied and taken for granted. During my annual review I came prepared with my accomplishments, strengths, and plans for the next year, coupled with demands for a merit/salary increase. While they agreed to the first part of the equation, they did not agree to the second. So, I went packing and applied like a &ldquo;cold call&rdquo; to a place that I had always admired, a place I thought of as a pinnacle in the open source community I was a part of.</p>
<p>When I put in my notice at the other place, guess what happened? Yeah, they offered me the salary I had asked for. Too late, my dream job offered me a 12% increase over that! But as with most things you place on a pedestal, they rarely live up to the ideals you imagined, and my dream job ended spectacularly. Over the years, and especially in the immediate aftermath, I thought I should write a book about the experience. I guess whatever I write here will have to serve as that now.</p>
<p>It was Labor Day weekend and we all got notice to be in the office by 9am the following week for an important announcement. This email came in <em>during</em> the holiday weekend, if I recall correctly. It may have actually made reference to a &ldquo;big new project&rdquo;. The big new project? The business was shuttering. But what happened when we returned to the office from the weekend went even further.</p>
<p>Not only was the business shuttering, but the middle management had known about this for some time and were doing all they could to save us, the workers, from having to scramble to find jobs on short notice, and, possibly worse, compete with each other applying to similar places. The work we did on the platform we used could very well end up that way. But I think how it actually went may have added insult to injury.</p>
<p>We were faced with what I can only describe as a panel of executives. If that makes you want to cry, well, yes, I did some crying later that day. For all of the &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; feelings this dug up in me, having left a job only a year earlier after feeling unappreciated and then only after threatening to leave was told &ldquo;yeah, sure we&rsquo;ll pay you what you think you are worth&rdquo;, this was bringing up a lot of bad feelings. I had come to this company with stars in my eyes, a company whose tagline was &ldquo;Technology for Good&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d spent a year working on a new platform for AmeriCorps VISTA.</p>
<p>This panel of executives was from a company based in Washington, DC, and they worked on giant platforms (using the same software we did) but it was anything but technology for good. Even before acquiring the dream job, this company had opened an office in Portland and garnered a reputation for paying high salaries but expecting workers to trash their work/life balance. I felt cornered, to put it mildly. The panel was there for the week, and they would be interviewing us all as an on-the-spot job application, so to speak. No, I&rsquo;m not joking. The next day I came in and was put into a small room with two guys, one I sort of knew from the tech meetup scene, and the other one was one of the owners of the company from DC.</p>
<p>The interview left me feeling all the things: imposter syndrome, like all my eggs were in this one basket, was I stuck in some contract that prevented me from looking elsewhere? Of course, you could choose not to apply and just finish out the month at our current company, as that is what the arrangement was: the current company would shutter at the end of September. You would interview with the new company, and if approved for a position, would spend that month &ldquo;working&rdquo; for them on a contract basis. Then we would all find out at the beginning of October if we had permanent full-time positions with them. It was hell. I felt like I was living on pins and needles for a month. It was like an ouf-of-body experience. I had to put feelers out there and see what other positions were viable lest I find myself hanging without a hope in a month.</p>
<p>And I did that, but I didn&rsquo;t actually end up finding an alternative. What I did do was build up a repository of information to come armed with if and when they gave me a job offer. I was surprised that it paid off and they gave me the salary I asked for. I took the job with the new company from DC and would be starting in their brand new office in The Pearl along with the fourteen other team members that were also coming on board, plus their existing staff that had been previously crammed into a tiny &ldquo;coat closet of an office&rdquo; in SE Portland, as well as anyone else from the company from across the country that would be moving to join us.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know what this looks like yet, but I&rsquo;ve been really upset with some of the conversations around Threads and the Fediverse. I need to organize my head, internalize some of the discussion, and really just keep to myself and finish writing some blog posts and pages I really want to finish. I&rsquo;m tired of feeling upset about it.</p>
<p>I do not envy what many Mastodon admins are grappling with right now. One of my favorite people on the internet, Adam of omg.lol, is a Mastodon admin on social.lol and watching him internally (and externally) feel tortured by this has upset me. But I&rsquo;m also upset just generally from how it is all playing out and what it reveals about people and society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m upset enough by my situation in life right now. How society has already placed constraints on my freedom and ability to thrive while a very real threat in virus form continues to circulate and cause disease, death, and disability. Another realism people just don&rsquo;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m stepping back in little bits. I will write my words in my own spaces. But I need some distance from all the conversations that are upsetting me &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m making progress in finding a medium of agreement and I don&rsquo;t have the energy with the day-to-day of my illness to continue to get upset.</p>
<p>Take care of yourselves, and each other. Have empathy and be as kind as you can. You don&rsquo;t know everyone&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>

			 <p>So even though the day started out a little rough, and I became distracted by searching for a new domain, I managed to get quite a bit done.</p>
<p>We have a wet storm coming tonight through Friday and then we&rsquo;ll get another stretch of fine weather. I have mulch being delivered Thursday and then I&rsquo;ll be out in the yard doing a bunch of spring work and spreading mulch. So I mowed, edged, and over-seeded the front lawn today.</p>
<p>I nearly finished a fairly long post on Custom about meta tags, site manifest, and favicons. I made a bunch of small updates to some content on weblog. I made some small posts and updated the About page on microblog. I drafted a post for Thursday for 3x5.pics. And I continued working on my weblog Favorites page which has taken on a life of its own now. I seem to be going room-by-room, and, yes, there is an entry for the bathroom!</p>
<p>The new domain is for a new blog, using one of the additional blogs from having upgraded to Micro.blog premium. I love having these small, seemingly single-purpose blogs, like 3x5.pics. Where the content is niche and I can sort of create a rhythm out of curating the content, almost like poetry. I think I&rsquo;d like this one to be like a &ldquo;secret blog&rdquo; though of course it isn&rsquo;t a secret.</p>
<p>It may be time for a some day note, I should have some fresh content for that soon!</p>

			 <p>I just spent a not insignificant amount of time putting a little polish on my microblog <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/about">About</a> page. Until today, there was still a &ldquo;WIP&rdquo; line right at the top and I&rsquo;ve been on here now for almost a year? Not quite a year, because I remember participating in last year&rsquo;s March photo challenge from social.lol.</p>
<p>The page is now organized into some lightweight sections and I added much more in terms of outside links to my other properties and sources of content. I primarily put this stuff on weblog, as the content there is much more in-depth and thought out. I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;off-the-cuff&rdquo; on Micro.blog. That is not to say I don&rsquo;t think before I write here, but I rarely make an outline before writing a post, and I nearly always do that for a weblog post.</p>
<p>I may want to add one additional section that describes more about what I write about and perhaps links to some of my multi-part series. I might also want to highlight what I&rsquo;ve done for my blogroll, both the entire page of recommendations on microblog, but also the larger project of making &ldquo;spins&rdquo; and posting a new set from time-to-time along with a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; link list with each set.</p>

			 <p>I turned on unique hits on Tinylytics for two of my sites and I suppose it makes the info not necessarily very usable until at least 30 days have gone by.

			 <p>I have a spate of photos from the garden this week due to our mini early Spring rain reprieve and abundant sunshine. The rain will return on Wednesday, but since about last Thursday we&rsquo;ve had consistent high 60s to mid-70s degree F. I was lucky with the magnolia this year as we did not get hit with a late cold snap in February and bud production went unhindered.</p>
<p>One of the best years on record for magnolia blooms, though perhaps a little hastened from the recent warm days. I&rsquo;ll still take it, far better than waiting a full year just to have the first 1/3 or blooms turn black and shrivel up from a desiccating and frigid east wind or ice event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sporadically posting photos here (via Featured Photo category) and on my gardening-centric Mastodon account, but after snapping a few shots outside this morning decided to upload a nice group to Flickr and share a first-of-kind Garden Status post! I haven&rsquo;t made this a category, not sure I will, but I&rsquo;ll tag it for series to it can at least be marked as that.</p>
<p>I think the remainder of this post will just be images‚Äîenjoy!</p>

<p>Patio containers in my garden this year feature a blue/purple/yellow/white palette, with some pinky/browns. Most are violas, pansies, primroses, and a few containers have some narcissus/daffodil.</p>

			 <p>Oh, boy, this picture brings back some memories. Not only was it the day after shit hit the fan in Portland with Covid, but it also coincided with a Snowpocalypse, so that Friday the 13th at the grocery store was a <em>doozy</em> and I remember coming home and crying.</p>
<p>Missed by a day, otherwise this would have been another &ldquo;On this Day&rdquo; featured photo post.</p>
<p>But it is well timed, regardless, with the state of the magnolia tree in the garden this year. Speaking of, we are in for a streak of sunny days reaching the low 70s and I&rsquo;m about to head out to the garden now!</p>

			 <p>I had something in mind, I searched for a recipe to work from (just to get some type of proportions right), and then threw in what I had on hand.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is a ditalini vegetable soup with:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 very large carrot, chopped</li>
<li>about 1 1/2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
<li>4-5 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 15-oz can cannellini beans, drained/rinsed</li>
<li>1 28-oz can whole tomatoes, with sauce (do not drain)‚Äîcrush in pot with masher/back of wooden spoon</li>
<li>1 large head of broccoli, cut into small florets</li>
<li>1 package frozen peas</li>
<li>6-8 cups vegetable stock (I used half water, you could probably use all water)</li>
<li>1/2 package ditalini pasta (about 1/2 pound)</li>
<li>a combination of, I didn&rsquo;t measure, but about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon each:
<ul>
<li>Italian seasoning</li>
<li>dried parsley</li>
<li>dried basil</li>
<li>dried thyme</li>
<li>bay leaf</li>
<li>red pepper flakes</li>
<li>kosher salt (to taste)</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper (to taste)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that is it&hellip;I might have missed something, I&rsquo;ll add it here if I remember anything more. You could add zucchini, baby spinach, brussels sprouts, it&rsquo;s a pretty versatile base. Substitute the cannellini for chickpeas or other canned bean. You could leave out the pasta entirely, though it does help thicken it up, perhaps try pearled barley instead (will take extra time to cook, might need to add it in with the liquid at the 30-minute simmer step).</p>
<p>Basically, sweat the first four ingredients with the olive oil, then add the rest, except for the ditalini. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or so. Add ditalini and continue to cook about eight more minutes. Turn off burner and let sit for another 20 minutes. Serve with fresh grated parmesan.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps especially on the IndieWeb there is a pretty heavy bias on male (and white) perspectives. I&rsquo;m seeing this in who is included in some popular email newsletters when there are equal and earlier published representations of the same content by non-male authors, and also in who is being included in blogrolls.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not disappointed even if I&rsquo;m not shocked. I am an aware female in this world, I live every day so this is unfortunately par for the course.</p>
<p>I will say that this is exactly why I chose to spin my blogroll. I wanted to be conscientious of who gets added, when they&rsquo;re added, and what the make-up of the set is at the time I add it. Of course, this takes time and thought and that&rsquo;s a lot more effort than some may want to put into it. I also wanted to include blogs that are new to me and that contain content outside of my usual circle.</p>
<p>The IndieWeb deserves better. We all deserve better. Broaden your horizons, folks. It is 2024 and you know what type of forces are out there on the rise. You can easily fight back against it by raising voices different than your own.</p>

			 <p>I barely made it through the first two paragraphs. I definitely didn&rsquo;t give it any more attention than that because I knew what it centered: an ableist attitude that prevails in media and politics right now and shuts out so many disabled and chronically ill people from every day life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NPR‚Äôs decision to platform a piece about the difficulty of navigating life with a spouse who can‚Äôt dine indoors, instead of a piece about the difficulty of navigating a society that has made dining indoors unsafe for vulnerable groups, is just that- a decision, and a political one.

			 <p>In the beginning of this adventure, it really was a daily featured photo that the Photo app on my iPad chose. But that has become less reliable and more redundant. I find myself seeking out photos that I am reminded of or if something unrelated has me looking back through time and I happen upon an image I <em>want</em> to use.</p>
<p>As mentioned recently, I am now compiling a list in Notes, a more curated list. This may mean I choose several images from the same trip. It might just mean a few of them are from the same year as I&rsquo;ve seen them closely together while scrolling through my Library. Either way, it is less random and more intentional.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is meaningless to you. Just know that they are no longer chosen by an algorithm in an app.</p>

			 <p>Back for another some day note. Somewhat on track for my two week target, perhaps two-and-a-half weeks this time. Hey, that&rsquo;s the point of &ldquo;some day!&rdquo; And speaking of notes, I have some &ldquo;notes&rdquo; for you this round üòâ</p>
<p>Every time I get to one of these I have to rewind my life and try to remember what the heck I did, where I went, what might be noteworthy‚Äîthere&rsquo;s that word &ldquo;note&rdquo; again, I can&rsquo;t escape it‚Äîand I find myself using my blog posts across my now numerous blogs to retrace the steps I&rsquo;ve taken. This is probably an obvious side affect of having a blog (or two, or three&hellip;) but something I hadn&rsquo;t considered. I might really appreciate this some day and it makes me want to retain this data even more when looking at my blogs from that perspective.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent a fair amount of time working on weblog, including checking several todo items off my ever-growing list. Something that came up spur-of-the-moment was adding a fun little web component that takes the URL to a Mastodon post and outputs a blockquote of the post with tallies of the interactions on the post (repost/reply/favorite). This is especially useful for Mastodon posts that share a blog post, as putting this at the end of your blog post serves as a &ldquo;Discuss on Mastodon&rdquo; prompt in lieu of comments or Webmentions, which is a whole other topic touched on briefly <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component">in this post</a>.</li>
<li>A little while back (mid-February) a post of mine made it into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/d.umn.edu/g/webdev">UMN web design newsletter</a>. This gets posted to Mastodon every time including all the authors who were included and I ended up getting a mention here on Micro.blog. But a little while later, it disappeared from my mentions. I have no idea what happened, but I wanted to enshrine it for posterity <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/22/heres-a-weird.html">in a post</a>.</li>
<li>The February Fakeout completely took me this year and <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/25/spring-has-come.html">spring has come to my garden</a>, though trepidatiously proceeding as March takes hold.</li>
<li>More work on weblog included creating a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/domain-map">Domain Map</a>, which was something I wanted to do instead of a &ldquo;sitemap&rdquo; since my domain is a suite and not just one site. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/creating-domain-map">write-up</a>.</li>
<li>After adding the &ldquo;Discuss on Mastodon&rdquo; component to weblog, I <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/27/post-interactions-between.html">compared the interaction options</a> with microblog and determined they have great parity.</li>
<li>I am the queen of series, apparently, and I can&rsquo;t leave well enough alone! I added yet another part to my microformats series, this time about <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/diving-into-indiewebify-me-microformats-part-viii">marking up recipes</a> and here&rsquo;s a recipe I just added after sharing a picture of the cake, <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/pumpkin-bundt-cake-with-cinnamon-glaze">Pumpkin Bundt Cake with Cinnamon Glaze</a>.</li>
<li>Of course, I had more to say about AI stuff:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/21/so-i-want.html">I shared a quote and bookmark for The Cost of a Tool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/22/please-do-not.html">I lamented on the introduction of AI browser summary tools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/22/about-a-month.html">More on the sour vibes AI has on the current state of the web and how it makes me feel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/29/im-glad-someone.html">A Mastodon quote and bookmark that summarizes the AI asthet<em>ICK</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/07/i-dont-know.html">A quote and link to a post in reaction to a recent article about AI and accessibility</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And perfect timing for this one after all that AI stuff: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/01/new-series-little.html">a new series I&rsquo;m calling Little Bright Spot</a>. I&rsquo;ll be using this when I need to cheer myself up or at least take some focus off all the bad stuff.</li>
<li>Back on weblog, I took the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/blogroll">Blogroll</a> for a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/blogroll-spin-2">second spin</a>.</li>
<li>I resumed work on themes.lol:
<ul>
<li>On styles, I wrote about <a href="https://styles.themes.lol/2024/03/color-swatches-html-elements">adding color swatches and continuing work on HTML element styling</a> and added a <a href="https://styles.themes.lol/style">Style List</a> landing page.</li>
<li>On custom, I wrote a post about <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/2024/03/customizing-weblog-header">customizing weblog header</a> and created a <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/posts">post archive page</a>.</li>
<li>On themes, I published a <a href="https://themes.lol/2024/03/march-2024-updates">March update</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After writing about technical things and doing technical work, I sometimes lose the motivation for blogging about interests and life, and I find <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/04/the-motivation-to.html">inspiration hits me at the wrong time</a>.</li>
<li>After two spins of the Blogroll + the initial set, <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/give-your-blog-a-name">I reviewed a trend in blog names</a>.</li>
<li>I wrote a little ranty post about <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/many-services-are.html">services that force users onto &ldquo;choose account&rdquo; pages</a> even when there is only one user account.</li>
<li>I upgraded to Micro.blog premium for several reasons, not immediately to be used, but something I had been dragging my feet on for a while. I found that existing bookmarks don&rsquo;t appear to archive? I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s a bug or something that is expected. I began using the Notes feature for tracking my featured photos series and using it to organize and plan ahead for the posts.</li>
<li>I published a first post in the series <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/my-me-life.html">My ME Life</a>.</li>
<li>There was a point within the last week that I realized that now that I have Micro.blog premium, and I already have five active omg.lol weblogs, I have the potential for <em>ten</em> blogs‚Äîhow many blogs is too many blogs? I also have nine sites (not all blogs) using Tinylytics right now.</li>
<li>And finally, back to that &ldquo;note&rdquo; thing I was hinting at, I finally got <a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a> <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/08/xpics-is-now.html">setup, designed, and mostly in a good place</a> while I continue to move things around and make it what I want.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s longer than a <em>note</em>, so long that Micro.blog&rsquo;s preview threw a <code>414 Request-URI Too Large</code> for previewing üòÜ I think that is my cue to end it here. Take care and have a great week!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A while back I got a hair-brained idea to create a notes blog that was to be pictures of notes on 3x5 cards. I think I got this idea after seeing <a href="https://micro.blog/petebrown">@petebrown</a> post several photos of notes on 3x5 cards and I commented on how I loved the format. I also asked permission to use it as an idea for a new blog. Pete didn&rsquo;t seem have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Soon after I bought a new <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> address during one of Adam&rsquo;s sales, I think it was during the holiday/end of year sale. That was quickly followed by acquiring a new matching domain: <a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a>. And then life happened, and I took time off from doing much of anything on my blogs for the second half of December and nearly all of January.</p>
<p>February I dedicated to doing some work and posting on <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol">Apple Annie&rsquo;s Weblog</a> and catching up on in-progress work for <a href="https://themes.lol">themes.lol</a>. Then this past week, just within the last three days, I started brainstorming and working with some design ideas. I went searching for the perfect 3x5 notecard online and was prepared to shell out for some new pens to get just the right ink-on-paper feel, but I was less than satisfied with the notecards I was finding. They were either bright white or brightly colored pastel, and the lines were also too bright. I had in my mind a sort of off-white card with faded lines, which I found a similar feeling to with the sort of chambray blue cards that feel kind of vintage.</p>
<p>Eventually I started working with color. I had already commissioned a nerdy bird with black-rimmed glasses and a number two pencil from <a href="https://socel.net/@heyheymomo">@heyheymomo</a> and used the colors as a jumping off point for my palette. I worked with the <a href="https://hihayk.github.io/scale/">color scale generator</a> I used for themes.lol and came up with a scale for each main color that I could work off of if I needed to go up or down the scale to ensure proper contrast between text and background.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I initially landed on six colors but ended up incorporating two additional colors because instead of taking pictures of 3x5 notecards, I created 3x5 notecards with HTML and CSS. The two additional colors are: an alternative blue to the main blue, two steps lighter on the scale, which became the background color of the notecard; and a dark burgundy that I pulled from the outlines of the nerdy bird and that became the main text color.</p>
<p>So even though the initial idea has morphed, I am enjoying the direction I have gone, and though perhaps a TLD like <code>.notes</code> might be more appropriate than <code>.pics</code> that domain doesn&rsquo;t exist and <code>3x5.blog</code> is more money than I want to sink in a side project for fun. I still think I can spin the <code>.pics</code> aspect of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still considering sources for content‚Äîwhat will be the text for these cards? am I the sole author?‚Äîas at one point I thought I might solicit contributions from <a href="https://some.pics">some.pics</a> that would allow me to take advantage of the community moderation so that I wouldn&rsquo;t be getting a bunch of junk. Since these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;pics&rdquo; that idea is sort of out. Though I also had the idea to generate pictures of each notecard to use as the HTML meta tag image and post to the @3x5@social.lol account that comes with my omg.lol address.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also considering a submission form and/or submission by email. Both of these would require far more moderation on my end and might open up a gate I&rsquo;d quickly want to close. For now, it is a single note on the homepage, the latest note, and I am writing them to be timely yet vague in content. I made an archive of all <a href="https://3x5.pics/notes">notes</a> and a <a href="https://3x5.pics/credits">credits</a> page to list the tools being used. I&rsquo;ve also got a todo list (I have so many todo lists!) with more tweaks and improvements and mostly underneath-the-hood of weblog configuration. But so far, this has been such a fun little project to spin out in a few days.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have set up the <a href="https://social.lol/@3x5">@3x5@social.lol</a> account and added notecard images for meta tags. I didn&rsquo;t get my nerdy bird aligned quite right so it is party cut off on the bottom but the next one will be right!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I published a new post on weblog on the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/creating-3x5-pics">creation of 3x5.pics</a>, more about the design and CSS and how the site is now working and even some updates I made today.</p>

			 <p>Part one of this journey, I have no idea how this will go or how cohesive I will manage to make it. I fear I might jump around a bit until I find a rhythm, so I apologize for that. Of course, I think this will get better as time goes on, not only because I&rsquo;ll get more used to writing about this stuff, but I&rsquo;ll also be getting closer in time to what I recall more easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m GenX, a mid-70s baby, just barely missed the US&rsquo;s bicentennial. My birthday also falls just short of Christmas. Apparently I came home in a stocking. I was a big baby and a very fast grower as an infant and toddler. You know how families do the measure-on-the-wall thing with a line? I passed up my sister in grade school. She is five years older than me.</p>
<p>I remember being 5 foot 4 inches in fourth grade. By the time I left elementary school I was already nearly 5 foot 8 inches. I started playing basketball in fifth grade. We had those grade school fitness tests every year and from fourth grade on I beat everyone, even the guys, at the running event. I didn&rsquo;t start running for sport until junior high, but I was also a long distance cyclist and backpacker for quite a while with my father, uncles, and cousins. More on this as this series continues.</p>
<p>My older sister resented me from the beginning and that relationship has never improved. When I was born we lived in a neighborhood in town with lots of neighbors and other kids to play with. I have a few early memories from that time period. Things like a small creek running along the side of our property, and a tree with a rope swing, as well as a rustic split-wood fence.</p>
<p>The garage had a small dirty bathroom in it and I can recall being out there at least a few times. The bathroom in the house had dusty pink fixtures, I remember taking baths in the bathtub. Off the back side of the house was a family room addition with a free-standing wood fireplace, one of those black metal jobs that were very popular from about the late &rsquo;60s through 1980s. I spent a lot of time in the family room, it was where I had all my toys and the time living in that house was all pre-school, even pre-preschool and kindergarten.</p>
<p>The friends we had there were mostly my sisters since I was so little (&lt;2 years old) but I still remember a few of them. One lady used to babysit us, name was Kelley, and we have a cookie recipe that we used to make called Kelley Cookies. There was a family of boys down the way that we used to play with too, and at the end of the road was a large erratic, common in this part of the country, either from volcanic activity locally or from being washed down from the Missoula Floods along the Columbia River. We&rsquo;d play on that hillside in the dirt and mud all the time and make a mess of ourselves. In fact, there are pictures of me from that time eating dirt, mud, and rocks.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what is wrong with me.</p>

			 <p>And I must tell you, dear service: I hate it. Have you considered the possibility of a sole human living in a home? With no other humans sharing services and devices? Has that ever crossed your mind? Warning: this gets a little ranty.</p>
<p>Some time in the recent past, all the services added the &ldquo;multi account&rdquo; options to their apps, sites, services, etc. and suddenly single-user setups, those that have ever only had one user since the beginning of the service, all the way to back to before you could add multiple users, are being constantly prompted to choose the user! I am so tired of this game. Netflix is doing this. Amazon is doing this. YouTube is doing this. THERE IS NO OTHER USER, JUST DEFAULT TO THE SINGLE USER THAT HAS ALWAYS USED THIS SERVICE.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t want to automatically do this, there should at least be a setting that says: only one user, or disable adding a second account, or bypass the choose user screen, or something! This happens so often, and sometimes, I kid you not, when trying to resume a paused show on Netflix, it will interrupt the action and suddenly refresh the app and take me to the choose user screen!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the point of this is. Whether the services are so desperate for user data that they want to constantly force you to <em>think</em> about who is watching the service? like, oh I forgot! d&rsquo;oh! there are many people watching! No! There is only one person here and there will only ever be one person here! Let me make that a preference please!</p>

			 <p>I was laying in bed reading blogs last night on my phone. I&rsquo;ll say I was trying to fall asleep, but who honestly stares at a bright rectangle and means they&rsquo;re trying to fall asleep. I probably bookmarked three or four blog posts that felt inspiring or had threads I wanted to untangle in my own post. But this morning the urge is gone and I&rsquo;m just here now talking about untimely motivation.</p>
<p>I worked too much on my computer over the weekend and my eyes feel fatigued today. I rolled out another <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/blogroll">blogroll set</a> on weblog with <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/blogroll-spin-2">accompanying &ldquo;spin&rdquo; post</a> and I updated all of the <a href="https://styles.themes.lol/style">styles on themes.lol</a> to include the color variants and light and dark theme tokens. I <a href="https://styles.themes.lol/2024/03/color-swatches-html-elements">wrote</a> <a href="https://themes.lol/2024/03/march-2024-updates">three</a> <a href="https://custom.themes.lol/2024/03/customizing-weblog-header">posts</a> and a page over there. So in all I wrote four blog posts, created one landing page (oh, right, I started another!), and updated a blogroll. And yet here I am whining about blogging motivation.</p>
<p>Often what I do is start a Draft with at least a working title, a small outline, or list of links to what I&rsquo;m thinking about for the post. I might do that today, dig out the bookmarks I added and get some posts outlined in Drafts. But I already have a growing list of in-progress drafts to finish and can&rsquo;t seem to find the motivation to do so. Why is that? Why are some posts so hard to complete? I want nothing more than to wrap up my Weblog Publishing Workflow post. It&rsquo;s like a chain around my neck at this point, dragging me down every time I think about it. I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> new blog post ideas, I already <em>have</em> blog post ideas, I just need to write them!</p>
<p>Perhaps drawing a line in the sand is what I need. It sounds punishing, but what if I tell myself I am not <em>allowed</em> to start or write another blog post until at least the workflow post is published? The last time I had this chain around my neck was before NaBloPoMo and I had two gargantuan (in my mind) posts in progress, both turned into series and have been quite popular according to <a href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a>. Does Weblog Publishing Workflow need to be a series? Maybe that is what is holding me up, I need to break it apart into concrete steps so that my mind will wrap around the complexity. Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, here we are, at the end of another unplanned blog post about my problems with blog posts, and having ideas, starting them, following through on them, and feeling terrible about motivations in the process. Ahh such is blogging life. What a life it is.</p>

			 <p>Today I updated the text on the &ldquo;Conversation on Micro.blog&rdquo; link to &ldquo;Discuss on Micro.blog&rdquo; to better match the perceived functionality of the new <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component">&ldquo;Discuss on Mastodon&rdquo; web component I added to weblog posts</a>.</p>
<p>Both blogs have a &ldquo;Reply by email&rdquo; link as well and now non-email interactions, though not exactly the same, will both follow the pattern of taking the user (replier who wishes to &ldquo;discuss&rdquo;) to the intended/desired platform I wish for them to discuss on for each blog platform.</p>
<p>The real difference still being that Micro.blog will add the discussion to the post (webmentions) and weblog will not, it will stay on Mastodon. But I think this is an acceptable difference, even when considering my choice not to put webmentions on weblog at this time.</p>
<p>I read a <a href="https://tantek.com/2024/023/t1/should-public-posts-flow-across-sites">recent post by Tantek</a> with even more spelled out thoughts and considerations regarding all of this. The primary difference I see right now between Micro.blog and weblog is that Micro.blog users, and perhaps people interacting with them, expect that replies will show up as a conversation on a post. The only caveat to this is when a Micro.blog post makes its way to a platform to like Mastodon, by POSSE/cross-posting, and someone there replies and their responses make their way onto the post on Micro.blog. I don&rsquo;t have a great solution to that right now, since this is built into the platform. But it may be okay if we consider that both Micro.blog and Mastodon use compatible protocols and weblog does not.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in a good spot right now on this, and I will absolutely keep my eye on how things evolve. I remain open to adding webmentions to weblog in the future if implementation can take consent and data impermanence into account.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t put much faith in the whole groundhog&rsquo;s day business over here on the west coast. We have our own indicators. In my garden that begins with planting primroses to accompany the overwintering pansies and violas in my patio containers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This year I also bought a pot of daffodils in a lovely butter yellow color. The corona is a bit darker, but so far the unopened bud form is nearly as lovely as the opened bloom due to that soft yellow of the petals. This contrasts nicely with a fanciful primrose I bought this year that has purple and white striped petals‚Äîvery unique!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The pansies and violas are a myriad of colors, but primarily shades of pink, yellow, white, and purple/blue. So augmentation this spring followed a purple and yellow theme.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Out in the garden we have other signs of spring. We&rsquo;ve just capped three absolutely gorgeous days here in Portland, where the sun was out and the temperatures reached nearly 60¬∞F (we might have actually reached it but I wasn&rsquo;t paying that close attention). Today we&rsquo;re overcast again, but sometimes that lighting is better for garden photographs as it allows for richer color and contrast.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The magnolia is bursting! This may be one of the earliest years for it, and‚Äîknock on wood‚Äîwe may be past the threat of any ice or desiccating cold winds out of the gorge, so I expect this to be a banner year for blooms. I am very hopeful, as the past two years had a damaged first round of blooms. At this point there is no turning back, the last three days of nice weather have plumped all the buds up, cracked the fuzzy protective casings, and shown us color with intent.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the ground I noticed this morning both the pulmonaria and brunnera have pushed buds <em>in just the last three days</em> as these clusters were not there earlier this week. And of course, the hellebores have been going for a week or so, though the ones in the backyard, especially <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/25/todays-featured-photo.html">the one under the magnolia</a>, are farther behind due to being on the north side of the house.</p>

			 <p>It was about finding joy on the web again, working with web tools and the indieweb, and writing about it on my weblog. If I&rsquo;m honest with myself, it was hard to write because when I started writing it in December I still truly believed it and felt it. But over the course of the past two months my feelings have gone sour again.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite place my finger on it. I know what it is now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s capitalism&rsquo;s ugly greed and all-consuming obsession with AI and attempts at shoving it into every single place it can be shoved (and more!) coupled with massive layoffs all over media and technology. I am disgusted, I am demoralized, again, by an industry that could do so much good, has such good people working in it, but is beholden, like everything else, to the ravenous appetite for profit that is killing everything on this planet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to fight this in my tiny little corner of the internet because even we are being attacked. We have to update our robots.txt to fend off the latest round of AI scrapers. We have to try to stop AI at the client-level from harvesting our content through the guise of a benign summary tool in a new-fangled web browser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s invading hiring processes even while hiring processes are already a labyrinth of impossible obstacles. It&rsquo;s denying healthcare. It&rsquo;s exacerbating climate change. And it is yet another shiny red bouncy ball for the easily impressed and distracted general public who marvel at typing words into a prompt and getting a bunch of nonsense back.</p>
<p>Democracy is Rome, AI is gladiator fights at the coliseum, and the public is entertained while everything burns.</p>

<p>The mention I&rsquo;m sure disappeared was from Mastodon and specifically mentioned me due to my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/08/i-think-about.html">I think about AI like I do Plastics.</a> post being in the UMN web design newsletter:</p>

			 <p>Well, this some day note is slightly belated. I&rsquo;ve somehow gotten off my every-two-week habit, probably due to my extended holiday + January break in blogging regularly. This note finds us nearly a month out from the last one.</p>
<p>Since these are mostly wrap-ups and overviews for a period of time, I&rsquo;m going to be gentle on myself. I think of these more for me anyway. So, if you are a reader of this type of thing and you&rsquo;ve been on the edge of your seat waiting on a new note, sorry! And also, <em>what</em>?!</p>
<p>With the caveat that this is belated, and the extended break, I confess December-February are just hard for me. I won&rsquo;t get all melancholy on that here, but it&rsquo;s true and worth calling out. If you have a tough time in your life, you probably understand. We all deserve grace and as this world continues to strip grace away from us, let&rsquo;s all try to find it where we can and offer it up to each other more readily.</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of February, I wrote a post called <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/small-web-small-life">Small web, small life.</a> where I talked about my desire to emulate the ideas of the small web into how I live my life. This is an economic task as well as a climate change task, and just seems like a little thing I can do to help both myself and the world out.</li>
<li>Over the past month, I crashed. I crashed a few times. The weather, the holidays, the world, life in general, has been hard, and my health has taken a beating. Even as I continue to shelter and try to regain some of myself from before 2018/2019 when my illness was less burdensome, I still deal with fallout. I published several blog posts on subjects surrounding my illness and crashing:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/01/things-i-surround.html">Things I surround myself with during a crash.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/04/my-me-life.html">My ME* life.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/08/finally-someone-is.html">Finally someone is saying it.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also published several posts about blogs/blogging, specifically about blogrolls. Matthias Ott&rsquo;s wonderful and popular <a href="https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/issue-08/">newsletter</a> finally convinced me to get one in place on weblog, and as is my habit, I had to put my own &ldquo;spin&rdquo; on it.

<li>Apple pissed a bunch of people off again and it made waves. As much as I&rsquo;m sure what they&rsquo;re doing could be viewed as a bad faith response (there&rsquo;s a bunch of &ldquo;malicious compliance&rdquo; being tossed around) to the EU&rsquo;s recent rulings/regulations, they are absolutely not alone in making decisions for their business above/over that of the user. The difference is when Apple does this everyone gets all self-righteous about it, and there&rsquo;s much less of this response when it&rsquo;s Google, Microsoft, or any other Big Tech. Even when there is a response to the others it rarely goes on for as long as this latest Apple thing has. I posted a few quips about this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/06/theres-an-awful.html">There‚Äôs an awful lot of anti-Apple sentiment&hellip;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/15/oh-goodie-more.html">Oh, goodie, more fuel for the Apple hate fodder&hellip;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had some ideas for post series, including one listed above about my chronic illness.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/04/my-me-life.html">My ME* life.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/07/i-seem-to.html">I seem to be having post series ideas lately.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was a lot of AI news over the last few weeks. It appears to be coming at us from all angles, everyone is trying to shove AI into every space they can, hoping it pans out to a financial win. It isn&rsquo;t for us, you and me, that they&rsquo;re doing this; they want an &ldquo;easy out.&rdquo;

</ul>
</li>
<li>The gardening season in my area is nearly upon us. In fact, I might claim it already is, as long as we don&rsquo;t get another late cold snap. I visited family and a garden and got &ldquo;stuck in&rdquo; this past weekend in my yard and every year this feels like a miracle after the doldrums of winter.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/11/a-symphony-of.html">A symphony of early spring blooms.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/12/i-follow-a.html">I follow a cool season lawn care calendar.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Fediverse is seeing some shenanigans related spam, first via DMs and most recently via mentions. I didn&rsquo;t write anything about that, but I&rsquo;ve been watching it closely. There were some other indeweb related topics that I did write about though:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/12/theres-a-new.html">There&rsquo;s a new instance in town to block</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/13/really-interesting-and.html">Really interesting and thought provoking considerations.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I added a new soup recipe to weblog: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/pumpkin-barley-sage-soup">Pumpkin, Barley, and Sage Soup</a></li>
<li>Yesterday I published a &ldquo;shower thoughts&rdquo; post about <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/why-stick-with-netflix">Why I stick with Netflix.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for now, hopefully the next note will be in two weeks. Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>I just read Dave Rupert&rsquo;s blog post <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/02/robo-barf/"><em>A dozen thoughts about AI</em></a> and many points stood out for their shock value, their humor, frankness, and compassion. But perhaps this one more than any.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worry automating accessibility would give way to a libertarian mindset where accessible technology is an individual‚Äôs concern, not an everybody responsibility and what externalities we do have in making accessible websites will go away. We already see this with overlay companies. Rather than fix issues at the source, we put the onus on the disabled person to figure out how to use a dongle so they can buy underwear on the internet. That‚Äôs inequity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s already so hard to get any abled person to truly understand how difficult it is to navigate such an ableist world. I&rsquo;m dismayed at the potential for AI to make things even harder to gain equal access.</p>
<p>I wonder how many folks realize we are already doing this with public health and Covid. We have made Covid an individual&rsquo;s problem. Disabled and chronically ill folks (Hi! üëã) must absorb all the risks in order to do just about anything now, including accessing healthcare. I don&rsquo;t anticipate any of this to get easier, and AI will not help.</p>

			 <p>Regarding the ethics and privacy implications of Brid.gy and webmentions in general, I&rsquo;m really going to be thinking about all this.</p>
<p>I have everything on weblog setup, I just need to implement webmentions, but I&rsquo;m now considering shutting everything down! Including blocking all of <code>brid.gy</code> in general on Mastodon. But that is the entire mechanism of micro.blog&rsquo;s interactions so it&rsquo;s a lot to take in.</p>
<p>Links, some are threads worth reading many of the comments:</p>

<li><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/mastodon-webmentions-and-privacy/">https://rknight.me/blog/mastodon-webmentions-and-privacy/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, this has me even reconsidering how I am adding &ldquo;Reply by email&rdquo; responses to weblog without the consent of the replier. I now want to explicitly ask the replier if they want their reply published on the post.</p>
<p>Opt-in over opt-out! Request consent, don&rsquo;t assume approval!</p>

			 <p>I often need to expand the coverage by 2-weeks to a month (on either end, fall and spring) due to the very long growing season in Portland. How long is Portland&rsquo;s growing season? Well, up to 50 days longer than just an hour north up Interstate-5, and up to 100 days longer than the south of Puget Sound in Washington (around Olympia).</p>
<p>The lawn care calendar starts in March with treating moss and adding ammendents (such as lime). I&rsquo;m likely going to do that this week, the second week of February. I already have sun-loving perennials showing growth, and my magnolia buds are swelling to a degree that I&rsquo;m concerned a late-February cold snap may damage them (again, like last year).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anxious to get some pre-emergent down to tamp down the bad grasses that like to take hold early in the growing season. I have a few bare patches in the back lawn from animals that were digging late last fall. The sooner I can get those seeded the better that weeds won&rsquo;t take hold.</p>
<p>The lawn isn&rsquo;t the most exciting garden subject, but I do have two small patches that act as &ldquo;a break&rdquo; in the garden. A place for the eye to rest, and for my rather small yet packed garden to create &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; so I like to make those patches as nice as possible. Since they are small, I don&rsquo;t see my water usage become astronomical. The back lawn is rather shaded by the magnolia once it leafs out. The front lawn is about a third-to-half the size of the back lawn.</p>
<p>Eventually, I do want to remove the front lawn. I have plans to extend the basalt stepping stone path from the side yard, beyond the side gate, to wrap around to the front walk. I&rsquo;d then like to remove the remaining grass and expand the flower bed that abuts the front terraces. If budget allows I&rsquo;d love to have the concrete sidewalk on the other side of the front walk removed, and also become stepping stones. That could wait until a later time when perhaps I redo the driveway, but that is a giant undertaking.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I drove to visit family and a garden that has lovely early spring flowers. The visit was long overdue as I hadn&rsquo;t seen them since before the holidays but every time the visit would get planned it would soon be delayed. In fact, I was first slated to do the visit on Friday, but we all decided the weather looked better for Saturday, and boy howdy am I glad I waited.</p>
<p>We took the usual stroll around the grounds and just happened to time it so perfectly that the light is what literally &ldquo;shines&rdquo; in the photos that follow here. Any earlier or later in the day, I guarantee these would not have turned out the same. In the following shots, a sea of spring-flowering crocus, cyclamen, and a few hellebore blooms, amongst a garden of mostly towering rhododendrons that will take center stage come May.</p>

			 <p>What I&rsquo;ve known since I figured out what was going on four years ago: this is <em>not</em> a new illness.</p>
<p>Some people just want it to be, it would be more convenient if it was. So they can treat it differently, ignore the malfeasance and destitution they&rsquo;ve placed ME/CFS sufferers in for decades, and to move forward without the weight of the malignancy that has been placed on us by doctors, the medical community as a whole, and the CDC.</p>

<p>No one will ever ever convince me to let down my guard and get Covid. Ever. I&rsquo;ve lived a life with ME/CFS. I will not roll the dice to get worse. Life, health, is too precious. What I have left I will not let be stripped away from me for a fleeting moment of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; that in the long run means nothing. You cannot truly understand what it means unless you&rsquo;ve been locked inside a chronic illness for decades with no treatment, no cure, and hardly any recognition by medicine.</p>

			 <p>Plastics were never really your friend. It was forced on society by a giant lobby group dead set on making it ubiquitous and spread across life. Same with AI, it isn&rsquo;t really your friend, it is being forced on us to occupy all segments of life.</p>
<p>Just like Plastics, it will be everywhere and in everything and impossible to remove. It will seep poison into that which you think is pure. Most of it won&rsquo;t be able to be &ldquo;reused&rdquo; or recycled, which isn&rsquo;t even really a thing. Plastic recycling was always a feel-good myth so that consumers didn&rsquo;t feel bad about using plastics. But we know now most of it makes it into a landfill. Plastic recycling degrades plastic and it can&rsquo;t be used again in the same manner. Plastic recycling equipment is expensive and cannot handle small plastic.</p>
<p>The lobby doesn&rsquo;t care about any of it this. This is a <em>you and I</em> problem once it gets out there. This is why pushing back on AI is so important to do <em>now</em>. Also, stop using plastic when there is a perfectly acceptable (and most of the time better) <em>non-plastic</em> alternative.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s another one: I have defined about four to five chapters in my life. They&rsquo;re all roughly ten years in length, some a bit shorter, others a bit longer. They all have &ldquo;endings&rdquo; due to events or decisions, and I&rsquo;d love to write about them.</p>
<p>I suppose it is a bit autobiographical, and each chapter might be a single post or more. I&rsquo;d have to see how long they get and whether sub-headings could define delineation points or places to move to a new post, keeping in mind I like to keep things on the shorter side on microblog.</p>
<p>As a first step I may create an outline, it might take the shape of a spreadsheet, as that is where I seem to put things lately that I want to act on. This may tie into <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/04/my-me-life.html"><em>My ME life</em></a> series that I posted about the other day, but it really is separate. It&rsquo;s more about my experiences since childhood to now, and how varied it has been even though I sometimes look at my life as being dull. It hasn&rsquo;t been, it&rsquo;s good to remind ourselves of that even when contemporary times feel stagnant.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had this idea for a while. I haven&rsquo;t been sure where I wanted to put it or how I wanted to start it, but I think I just need to get into it. I want to write through my health history, all the way from childhood, as much as I can remember.</p>
<p>I want to document my healthy and robust times, how normal life was before getting chronically ill. I want to show how easy it is to slip away and lose everyone and everything that came before an illness. Mostly, I want to do this for me to understand the patterns, which I&rsquo;m hoping I may start to see. I already see them in my mind when I think back, but I hope writing them out will make them even more clear.</p>
<p>This will probably be several posts, but maybe it will be just one post that I keep adding to. I know I&rsquo;ll have to go back and edit as I recall events, so needing to edit many posts or remember where something fits in to one or more posts may be difficult. That makes me think one long post is the way to go. Ideally this could be plotted on a timeline, but that may need to wait until the end when I can pull out high-level events and make them visual.</p>
<p>I guess this post serves as a marker that I want to do this and that I think I want to put it here. This won&rsquo;t necessarily be a &ldquo;micro&rdquo; post, though, and that is mostly what I&rsquo;ve been using microblog for. If it begins to feel out of place, I can always move it to weblog, perhaps a standalone page or section. I have posted other ME/CFS and Covid-related content there before, though I have here too. It almost feels like I need a totally separate blog/location for this stuff, but I really don&rsquo;t want to maintain another project.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Wow, it&rsquo;s been a minute! My last <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/some-day-note/">Some Day Note</a> was the end of November as I was preparing to wrap-up <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/nablopomo/">NaBloPoMo</a> and then I posted a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/grandiloquent-note/">Grandiloquent Note</a> (first of its kind!) at the end of December as a yearly wrap-up. Today&rsquo;s note will cover the holidays and January, an admittedly difficult time of year for many people and myself, and I feel like it was a little quieter than usual so let&rsquo;s see how this one goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished my first NaBloPoMo and really enjoyed the experience, <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/nablopomo-2023-wrap-up">I wrote about it on weblog</a>.</li>
<li>As I had previously written about during NaBloPoMo, I&rsquo;m working on a (personal) project for weblog. It became more real when I acquired a lifetime omg.lol address and new domain: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/weblog-themes-for-real">Weblog themes, for real?!</a> I finally got started on this over the past two months, scaffolding out <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/launching-with-styles">some initial styles</a> based on accessible color duos, and creating a base for the three adjoining omg.lol addresses that will live under my new domain. I also wrote a few blogs posts and info pages for each, including a couple customizations just to give a feel for how I envision the three addresses working together.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m getting back into the habit of posting a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/">featured photo on microblog</a> at least weekly if not more often.</li>
<li>I finished the microformats series (for now) and published a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/diving-into-indiewebify-me-microformats-a-series">series landing page</a>. It got some attention I had not expected and was picked up by <a href="https://adactio.com/links">Adactio Links</a>. I still expect to finish out the series with a post on adding webmentions when I get around to doing that.</li>
<li>One of my largest endeavors in the last two months was a first-step in a major CSS refactor for weblog. I had many goals for this first-step, but most importantly was moving as many assets as possible to my CDN so as not to rely on loading third-party assets. This also required swapping out my two main webfonts and tackling some performance improvements. I covered most of this in <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/an-organized-head">a weblog post</a>.</li>
<li>In December, another omg.lol member wrote a flattering post about the platform&rsquo;s offerings and it went viral on Hacker News, my blog was linked from it and had <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/10/i-am-here.html">a bunch of traffic</a> that interrupted my previously mentioned CSS refactor.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/16/making-a-birthday.html">I had a birthday and made myself a cake.</a></li>
<li>I preemptively blocked Threads on <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/blocking-threads-net-on-mastodon">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/22/done-added-better.html">micro.blog</a>.</li>
<li>Christmas was rather uneventful: I stayed up late on Christmas Eve and slept in on Christmas day, and ate a bunch of food.</li>
<li>On New Years <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/31/today-is-a.html">I reminisced about a past life</a> and then <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/01/02/its-a-hard.html">talked about how hard this time of year is</a>.</li>
<li>Then we had two storms that brought <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/01/13/today-is-pretty.html">unusually cold weather</a> and an <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/01/17/the-ice-storm.html">ice storm with power outages</a> to the region. These types of weather events have an outsized influence on my wellbeing as a chronically ill person, and I&rsquo;m still not completely over it nearly a week later.</li>
<li>Finally, it was my omg.lol anniversary earlier this week, one year on the platform, and I wrote a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/01/a-love-letter-to-omg-lol">short love letter about how the time has passed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too bad, I think I got some good stuff in there. Take care and have a great weekend!</p>

			 <p>In the US, and elsewhere, there is the idea of &ldquo;protected classes,&rdquo; those being a set of people that fall into the class that are protected from discrimination (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group">very broad definition</a> from Wikipedia). I am not a lawyer, and I don&rsquo;t have much insight into how these are handled overseas, so my opinion here is very North American and limited to that viewpoint. In most instances, these classes are protected under a limited set of circumstances, such as employment.</p>
<p>Lately, a lot of companies, either via actions taken by the company itself, or through actions by the owners/founders/CEOs/board members, have revealed how they truly feel about many protected classes. This includes antisemitism, bigotry, racism, eugenics, sexism, and more. Some of these companies are: Brave (by extension Kagi), Substack, 37Signals, and many more. In fact, I would even include Apple in this list, for their most recent move to relocate some Siri-related teams to Texas, a wholy-hostile state to anyone who can get pregnant. I will not go into the specifics of the other companies I listed.</p>
<p>But I reached a line last week, and I had to stop following some people and muting some others, when they compared the feeling that minorities and marginalized (protected class) groups have towards the companies above (plus more not listed) to being a developer in Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem. &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; is not a protected class and Apple is not denying you an inalienable right to exist in this world. I cannot sit by and watch these alligator tears no matter how hard Apple is making it to be a developer in their ecosystem. It just is not even comparable to having your very existence on this earth be at risk simply for who you are.</p>
<p>I hope some people can step back from this ledge they&rsquo;re on and gain some perspective. I understand that making money is important and Apple wants to take a bigger and bigger slice for themselves. That&rsquo;s a tough place to be in. Apple is a capitalist, as are people making software for the Apple ecosystem. That is capitalism and the &ldquo;free market.&rdquo; Apparently, if you don&rsquo;t like it, you can go to a different market. That sucks, but Apple is not trying to kill you in that respect. Their move to relocate offices to Texas? I would argue that could very well kill you if you can get pregnant.</p>

			 <p>Yes, I did watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ice_Storm_(film)">The Ice Storm</a> the other day, but this post is not about that. It&rsquo;s about another ice storm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m due for a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/some-day-note/">Some Day Note</a> but honestly the past 4-5 weeks have just been exhausting and demoralizing and I don&rsquo;t quite have a serious blog post in me yet. I lamented a bit about this on Mastodon the other day, hoping the days would get easier. Well, this past week was like a laugh in my face about that.</p>

<p>The Portland metro area saw, first, a wind storm with arctic blast, that drew frigid inland continental air through the Columbia River gorge into the Willamette valley. Then inches of snow and sleet fell, and now a freezing rain event, all over five days of sub-freezing temperature, several in the mid-teens. Portland has not gotten down to these temperature in 35 years.</p>

<p>Over the weekend 200K+ customers lost power. Today at least 80K, if not more, still have no power. At one point, our natural gas provider warned everyone to cut down on gas usage, this apparently due to the storage and pipeline infrastructure failing in the sub-freezing temperatures. Then a large sewage treatment pipeline in Portland froze over and our sewage system was operating at only partial capacity. Some area in east Portland had a back-up, sending sewage into at least a dozen homes.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;m done with my mini-rant on the subject. I&rsquo;ve surveyed the garden and may have a few casualties, as 14-15¬∞F is below what my previous zone 8b plants should be able to handle, and now I&rsquo;m supposedly a zone 9a. We shall see how this affects the garden more this spring. I&rsquo;m not too worried, losing plants is an opportunity to plant more. But I took a few photos this morning and put them up on Flickr. I&rsquo;ve scattered them throughout this post.</p>

			 <p>We aren&rsquo;t used to this weather, and we&rsquo;re even more unprepared than the rest of the country. We might get this type of system once a year, but it hardly gets as cold as it is today. Our high today won&rsquo;t even reach 20¬∞F, it is 15¬∞F right now. It&rsquo;s been ~35years since that last happened here in Portland.</p>
<p>Right now I still have power, but that isn&rsquo;t a given. It&rsquo;s currently sleeting and if that transitions to freezing rain or ice, we could be looking at more trees down and power lines. With such frigid temperatures, that&rsquo;s a pretty bleak scenario to also not have power.</p>
<p>Since I got up this morning at 6am, I&rsquo;ve pretty much done nothing but swap out hummingbird feeders. We are a northern climate, but still mild enough (most of the time) that Anna&rsquo;s hummingbirds remain here year round. And if you are &ldquo;known&rdquo; as a regular feeder changer, that is, you don&rsquo;t let it run dry, or get sticky and dangerous, or let it grow mold and bacteria, you will be rewarded by having a &ldquo;resident&rdquo; in your yard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pretty much had a resident Mr and Ms Anna&rsquo;s since about 2018, when I really started paying attention and being serious about keeping my feeders filled and cleaned. It also means that on days like today <em>you are their lifeline</em> as there is nothing else out there for them right now. Anna&rsquo;s feed on nectar, but they also feed on small insects, they are quite talented bug catchers. There are no bugs out and about today, and very few things blooming. So the feeders <em>must</em> be rotated as they freeze.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on my 5th or 6th rotation for the day. I finally upped my sugar ratio to give them a little more pep, but also act as an antifreeze. It may or may not be making a difference. This time I also decided to experiment with Christmas lights to see if that would create a little extra warmth to keep the juice from freezing up. Also unsure as to how effective it has been, but the hummingbird appears to <em>like</em> the lights! He has been sitting on the bulbs in various places all day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tonight I&rsquo;ll bring both feeders inside after dark, and return one of them before they come in the morning. We should warm up to at least the mid-20s tomorrow, warm enough that the larger feeder should stay thawed most of the day. I&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on it. But our nights will continue to get into the teens for a few more days.</p>
<p>Tough to decide whether 15¬∞F and snow/sleet/wind is preferable to 116¬∞F during a heatdome. I&rsquo;d rather have 60¬∞F and slight overcast, to be honest.</p>

			 <p>Definitely YOLO&rsquo;ing my morning. The power was out for nearly five hours last night and as soon as it came back on I was wide awake and making coffee before 5am. Cuddling up now and enjoying the peace before the &ldquo;day&rdquo; starts. No snow at my house but surrounding areas got some. Plenty of wind, though.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been so weighed down lately I made three separate online orders this past week, one of them was delivered today. I ordered a bunch flour from King Arthur Baking. I oscillate between Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill and King Arthur flours, depending on my mood or where I&rsquo;m shopping.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s no longer does e-commerce from their site, something that I used quite a bit during the first few years of the pandemic, as I was baking a lot (still am). I like to order in a good quantity so I don&rsquo;t run out every couple weeks.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s order I also got a new half-sheet pan with cooling rack insert on sale, which was nice to offset the shipping cost. IIRC Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill offered free shipping over a certain dollar amount. Not so much with King Arthur.</p>
<p>I made a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/spiced-applesauce-cake">spiced applesauce cake</a> last week, and the size of my applesauce jar is just enough for one of those cakes + my favorite applesauce oatmeal bread recipe from King Arthur. So it seems like perfect timing to make the bread loaf today!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the recipe: <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/applesauce-oatmeal-bread-recipe">Applesauce Oatmeal Bread</a></p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll come back and edit this post with a picture after it comes out of the oven‚Äîif I can follow through with my baking plans for the day üòù</p>

			 <p>This isn&rsquo;t a complaint post, just reality. The little bits that keep me going, knowing that in a few months the garden will come to life. The narcissus is poking up in this galvanized container on my patio. The ornamental cabbage is beginning to extend upward and will eventually bolt. Life will return.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every year feels a little harder than the last. It&rsquo;s a combination of factors that seem to pile upon each other to make this time of year feel unbearable. But by the end of summer, that time too feels unbearable. Perhaps it is the lack of continuity that is unbearable.</p>
<p>I wish the humans could give each other some continuity. We at least have control over that bit, but it seems we choose not to. We force pain upon each other instead of choosing grace and empathy. I&rsquo;m certainly glad we&rsquo;ve rounded the New Year corner though. There is some sense of satisfaction in that at least.</p>

<p>The next hurdle is making it to March when the magnolia will begin to bloom and I can heave a giant sigh of relief. February is the last nemesis that could impact the magnolia. If we get a late freezing storm out of the Columbia Gorge that coincides with moisture from the Pacific in a way that blankets the metro in ice. The magnolia buds can become damaged if they&rsquo;ve progressed far enough along when that hits. It&rsquo;s always extremely disappointing when that happens. If it doesn&rsquo;t, though, the tree will be glorious. I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers because she is loaded with buds this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the pansies and violas are living their best lives in my patio containers. I just love their friendly joyful faces and cannot imagine winter without them. How did I ever survive? I can look out on them from my kitchen. I can sit in the protection of the patio cover during inclement weather, sip coffee or tea, and photograph them. They are the most economical bits of joy during this time of year. I used to buy packets of seed to grow them, but now I just buy 20-30 plugs or 4-inch nursery containers of mixed varieties and colors and throw them into seven patio containers willy-nilly and wait to see what color combos land. They usually make a splash!</p>
<p>Alright, enough rambling for now. I have other <em>important</em> blog posts to write.</p>

			 <p>This December 31, I recall that it marks the 20th anniversary of events that set off this part of my life. Though, I suppose I&rsquo;m actually in another chapter that started in late 2019. But the overarching chapter that began with me leaving the area I grew up, moving to Portland, going back to college, buying a house, and doing everything else that followed.</p>
<p>In 2003 I broke up with my long-time high school boyfriend that I had been dating‚Äîthough with the way young relationships go, we had been &ldquo;off&rdquo; a few times‚Äîmore than ten years. That Christmas I received a phone call at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning from his cousin and best friend that his wife and my ex-boyfriend were having an affair and that she&rsquo;d moved in with him.</p>
<p>Over the next week I attempted to confront him about this, but he refused to answer my calls. He still lived in the house we had once shared and I tried several times to contact him there. But still, no luck. On NYE that year, I spent the night at my family&rsquo;s home, and when it began to snow I headed home to my apartment in town.</p>
<p>On the highway just below my family home, just as I was turning onto it, that ex-boyfriend drove by. This many years later, I do not believe in coincidences and this was surely meant to be, if only to get me to do something, and something I did. I followed him home. The house was just a few blocks from my apartment, as even after we had stopped dating the first time and I moved out, we still spent a lot of time together, so I stayed close by.</p>
<p>I drove up to the house and sat in the driveway as snow piled up on the lawn. I got the nerve up to go up to the front door, but I&rsquo;m not sure what I expected to happen, because it wasn&rsquo;t fruitful and I soon left, walking back across the lawn. Though I did not leave right away. I sat in my car looking at his cars and her car in the driveway, and looking back over the lawn I had just crossed as my footsteps disappeared while snow filled their space.</p>
<p>The following year I bought a new car, I worked enough hours to accrue benefits at my job, I took a trip to Puerto Rico, and I decided to go back to college. I started college the following fall, but moved to Portland in May and continued to work at the same place, though different location, until 2008 when I took my first web development job. I graduated college in early 2011, took a cruise to Alaska that summer, and bought my house later that year.</p>
<p>Today when I look back at 20 years having gone by from those events, it feels like just yesterday. And 30 years since we were in high school, I&rsquo;m not sure where the time has gone. Everything that I&rsquo;ve done since then has been without him but definitely because of him.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, everybody, make what you can of it. Endings are sometimes beginnings in disguise!</p>

			 <p>It has been nearly a month since I wrote a Some Day Note! In realizing this a week ago I fretted a bit but then by putting it off another week I now can just use this as a reason to write a year-end note. But of course, I had to come up with a <em>name</em> because if there&rsquo;s one thing I like to do, it is to name things.</p>
<p>Grandiloquent Notes is born!</p>
<p>I was trying to generate a name that somewhat poked fun at year-end traditions. I&rsquo;ve always disliked resolutions. The idea of looking back at an entire year and prophesying always felt bombastic. I was actually trending towards some rather morbid terms but then decided against that.</p>
<p>I landed on &ldquo;grandiloquent&rdquo; by rabbit-holing on Merriam-Webster from &ldquo;note&rdquo; to &ldquo;resonant&rdquo; to &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; to &ldquo;grandiloquence&rdquo; to &ldquo;grandiloquent,&rdquo; which ultimately is &ldquo;grand speech&rdquo; from Latin <em>loqui</em> (to speak) and <em>grandis</em> (grand or great). I think this is just about perfect: pokes fun at the thing but at the same time gives me permission to go with it. My favorite type of naming.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>
<p>As with the previous three years, 2023 has been a tough one. The world just wants to move on from something that refuses to move on from them. Denials on the continued spread of a disease that is killing and disabling thousands is on all of us and should sit with you during this season. Many people will stay home alone due to conditions they already have that prevent them from even taking a chance of catching it lest it make them worse, or kill them. Many more will gather with supposed loved ones and spread that disease, knowingly or unknowingly. I don&rsquo;t know how we tackle some of our existential societal challenges if we can&rsquo;t even agree on this. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say on it. This is one of the hardest times in my life and I&rsquo;ve lost so much faith in my fellow humans.</p>
<p>On a much more positive note, though I will not go as extensively into it as I will in an upcoming weblog post, I sort of fell into joining a few online &ldquo;communities&rdquo; this year. I spent 18 months in 2018 and 2019 in the worst stages of burnout at a job I&rsquo;d ever encountered. It broke me so badly, and then was followed up by a global pandemic and waves of intense hiring and firing, that I had basically vowed to never work in the industry again. I went <em>years</em> without writing a single line of code. I fell into omg.lol in late January 2023 after: a) coming across the social.lol Mastodon instance and wanting to join it, and b) hearing the Do By Friday episode where they talked about it.</p>
<p>I then also signed up for Micro.blog, but forgot about it (I have talked about this elsewhere before) until the summer when I finally subscribed and got moving on incorporating a microblog into the rest of my web life. Over the next 11 months I&rsquo;ve pretty much changed my whole feeling on the web and tech industry. I&rsquo;ve jumped back in with some reservations and boundaries that I will attempt to hold onto lest I fall into the same traps that burned me before. I am concentrating on the small, intentional, and independent web and purposely avoiding the capitalist web. If I hope to ever work on the web again, it won&rsquo;t be <em>for</em> but rather <em>with.</em> An important distinction. I will not let capitalism consume my remaining years.</p>
<p>This year has also seen some hard times in my family. I&rsquo;m getting up there in age, but my parents are <em>really</em> getting up there in age. My father is now the primary caretaker of house and home, where it was always my mother before her recent health issues. He&rsquo;s having to learn how to do everything that he never had to do before. She&rsquo;s cognitively declining but also fighting a body that is slowly deteriorating beneath her. Eventually I will need to be closer to them as my father is going to start to fail at some point too. I imagine 2024 to be tumultuous in many ways.</p>
<p>I participated in two monthly photography challenges on Micro.blog, one in March before I was <em>on</em> Micro.blog (even though I already had an account! silly me&hellip;) and another in September. I enjoyed these but rather also enjoy my personal habit of posting a (nearly) daily featured photo from the iPadOS Photos app. I started writing semi-regular &ldquo;notes&rdquo; called Some Day Notes (reference above, tied to this note), also on my microblog. And I&rsquo;m slowly dipping into creating a custom theme for my microblog, currently I&rsquo;m using Tiny Theme with a thick layer of CSS customization (and a few templates).</p>
<p>I challenged myself in November to participate in National Blog Posting Month and to write something every day of the month, and I succeeded! I really never thought I would do it, but I did! It was quite an experience. I ended the month having written over 25,000 words and writing 30 blog posts split (not evenly) between weblog and my microblog. I&rsquo;ve had some incredible traffic on weblog and some quite popular posts. One post was featured in a popular front-end curated newsletter (Friday Front-end). Another made it into a popular web-related podcast (ShopTalk Show). And still another (just last week!) was in Jeremy Keith&rsquo;s (AKA Adactio) link list üò± I have been exposed to incredible people in this process and feel less alone than at any point during this pandemic, but also on the web, even when I was working in-person with people in an office.</p>
<p>Weblog has been my home this year. I&rsquo;ve really poured quite a bit into it and it serves as my hub on the web, where all other parts of me collide. I first cobbled together a custom theme for myself in order to figure out how weblog worked and what could be accomplished. It&rsquo;s really how I learn best, by doing and tinkering. And now my whole web world lives on a custom domain: anniegreens.lol. I&rsquo;ve put so much into it I&rsquo;m now on a side quest to create styles and custom patterns for weblog themes. I acquired three new omg.lol addresses: styles, custom, and themes (the last one gifted to me by omg.lol) as well as another domain: themes.lol. I will be working on this in the coming months.</p>
<p>I think the above covers my &ldquo;big ticket items&rdquo; for the year. Absolutely nothing exciting, but then again, I haven&rsquo;t had Covid one single time and I&rsquo;m healthier than I have been in a couple years due to concentrating on keeping myself exposure-free, eating better, listening to my body&rsquo;s signals, and reducing stress, crashes, and PEM (ME/CFS hallmark condition). I also haven&rsquo;t had a secondary infection of any kind this entire pandemic because I wear a mask everywhere in public. Prior to the pandemic, and due to my existing chronic illness, I would get sick several times a year with colds, sinus infections, the flu, you name it. Nothing since I&rsquo;ve stopped breathing other people&rsquo;s expired air. Amazing what we could accomplish if everyone would get over their selfish &ldquo;rights&rdquo; (to get sick and get other people sick).</p>
<p>The only other part to this will be listing out and linking to all my Some Day Notes for the year, only starting in August, which include other specifics and highlights. In case you missed them at the time or want to look back, or you can ignore them and this post altogether!</p>
<p>Happy Holidays and a Merry New Year to you and yours‚Äîstay safe out there!</p>

			 <p>As I have mentioned before, I have ME/CFS, and have since childhood/adolescence. My mother and I spent years traveling around to doctors and specialists in the late 80s/early 90s, only to finally be given an &ldquo;answer&rdquo; but then be further psychologized and traumatized in the years following, so much that I just simply stopped talking about it or seeking help. I had to find ways within myself to function and they forced me to redefine what life could and would look like at such a vulnerable young age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many reading this will carry similar stories about themselves, often without truly realising it. In my case they came from medical professionals ‚Äì doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, psychotherapists ‚Äì but for other people the list will include family and friends. Even the most well-meaning of onlookers can unintentionally promote the idea of willpower as a means of overcoming illness. And for all of us, there is the additional influence of society and the media, with their emphasis on the sick and disabled as a drain on resources. It can be hard to escape the message that we must try harder. Do better. Make an effort to be less demanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to reading more about Naomi&rsquo;s journey of discovery, as I too am on a similar journey, though different and probably for contrasting reasons. Naomi seems to be doing better in her illness; I am doing worse.</p>

			 <p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been flailing over the past few days, arms raised and flying around wildly. I was deep in some refactoring and thrown off by increased weblog traffic, and even more by how much longer and more brain power the refactor took (is taking? I still don&rsquo;t feel completely done).</p>
<p>I should be writing a Some Day Note but that will come&hellip;some day, heh, see how that works?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a few in-progress blog posts I want to wrap up, I need to finish the performance updates I&rsquo;ve been working on, I want to look more into a couple variable font weirdness/bugs I&rsquo;m seeing, and I have to get going on moving my domain registrar so I can take over a new domain for a new project.</p>
<p>I think it is time to make some lists and prioritize because my brain is failing on its own.</p>

			 <p>The CSS and font architecture changes that I have been working on the past few days on weblog are now on hold until things calm down. I got far enough and was satisfied with the modifications until traffic on my blog rose to a level that I was no longer comfortable pushing updates.</p>
<p>In unfortunate timing, Blake Watson wrote <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/omg-lol-an-oasis-on-the-internet/">a lovely blog post about omg.lol</a> that hit the top of Hacker News and linked to my weblog as part of his review of the service offerings. It is an absolutely wonderful tribute to the service and <a href="https://adam.omg.lol/">Adam</a> that has spawned another slew of signups and created a traffic ripple effect to any other blog or post Blake&rsquo;s post touched on.</p>
<p>I just lamented on Mastodon that my Tinylytics hits for the day (actually just the last three hours!) absolutely dwarf all traffic that came before, including: a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/07/on-micro-blog-and-how-i-want-to-use-it">micro.blog post</a> that has gotten a ton of traffic since I wrote it this summer; a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/the-picture-element-for-unexpected-art-direction">post about the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element</a> that made it into <a href="https://fridayfrontend.com/">Friday Front-end</a>; and my <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">blog post about blog post types</a> that was mentioned in last week&rsquo;s ShopTalk Show.</p>
<p>Indeed, in just the last three hours my weblog has had 1/6th of the total all-time traffic it has ever received. I just spent a month during NaBloPoMo writing every single day, building up a consistent rate of traffic that, yes, just the last three hours laughed at.</p>
<p>So, hopefully things will calm down this evening (Pacific Time) or tomorrow so I can get my CSS and font updates in place. I will have a post following the changes where I talk through what and why I made them. Following that post, I too have a &ldquo;love letter&rdquo; to omg.lol due out to mark my one year anniversary with the service. And of course, I still have a weblog publishing workflow post to finish to accompany my new <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/colophon">weblog colophon</a>. That should have happened today, or yesterday, or Friday. Well, it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s Some Day Note is also today&rsquo;s #NaBloPoMo entry and is two days from the end of the goal‚Äîhow time flies! No, really, it has been a blast, and I never expected that I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed a day. There were only a couple times that it felt like a struggle, and I haven&rsquo;t even exhausted my <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/works-in-progress">Works in Progress</a> backlog yet.</p>
<p>So, what are today&rsquo;s notes?</p>

<li>I finally tackled replacing icon fonts (still using Fontawesome) in a way I didn&rsquo;t expect to be acceptable (for now) in NaBloPoMo entry 16/30: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/icons-fonts-svgsoh-my">Icons, Fonts, SVGs‚Äîoh my!</a></li>

<li>Not a NaBloPoMo entry, but <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/20/just-a-little.html">Just a little note about the power of blogging.</a> that prompted the next NaBloPoMo entry.</li>
<li>We got our second (I think?) frost in Portland for the season, and finally a stretch of much colder weather. This prompted all the trees to get their acts together and drop their leaves. Yay üôÑ. It&rsquo;s a popular recommendation to &ldquo;leave the leaves&rdquo; but when you live in a mild and wet winter climate this can lead to harboring fungal and insect issues in your garden. So, I do leave some leaves, but I really cannot leave a foot&rsquo;s worth of thick magnolia and apricot leaves stacked on my ornamental garden beds unless the leaves are mulched first. Suffice to say, I&rsquo;ve spent hours to days raking leaves and cleaning gutters over the past few weeks.</li>
<li>Will I ever finish this series?! Only time will tell - Diving into indiewebify.me &amp; microformats, Series additions:

<li>Apropos to the day ü¶É for NaBloPoMo entry 23/30: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/23/being-thankful.html">Being thankful.</a></li>
<li>I visited family again, this time more for the holiday (Thanksgiving in the US) than for just a random visit. I don&rsquo;t like traveling <em>on</em> holidays so I waited until the weekend.</li>
<li>I made a new muffin recipe to me (<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022716-cranberry-crumb-muffins">recipe</a>) and they turned out really good (<a href="https://social.lol/@anniegreens/111471855149154355">results</a>). When I make them again, I have some alterations I&rsquo;d like to try and then I&rsquo;ll probably add the recipe to weblog, as I do with recipes that I make a lot or riff on.</li>
<li>The holiday weekend may give folks time off but tech issues do not adhere to that. I lamented in NaBloPoMo entry 25/30: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/25/a-level-at.html">A level at which one functions with ease and familiarity.</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve created more work for myself! - NaBloPoMo entry 26/30: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/weblog-themes-for-humanity">Weblog themes for humanity.</a></li>
<li>Wow! Two humbling bits in NaBloPoMo entry 27/30: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/is-your-blog-for-you-or-other-people">Is your blog for you or other people?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for now. Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m traveling to visit family today so I won&rsquo;t have time to do a long thought-provoking or detailed post for NaBloPoMo. What I do want to explore, though, is an experience, or set of experiences, from yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of stuff: baked some muffins, watched some TV, did some yard work, housekeeping, etc. And I worked on a <em>seventh</em> part to a series on microformats I&rsquo;ve published on weblog. As with all NaBloPoMo posts I&rsquo;ve been keeping tally on micro.blog and linking to the weblog posts.</p>
<p>From the morning until I went to bed I was unable to get any logged-in pages on micro.blog to load for me. They would all time out. So, I was unable to post my tally, though I did complete my weblog post. This morning I killed the session(s) and some cache and tried again and finally got in.</p>
<p>Also, last night, after publishing my weblog post, I discovered some URLs on weblog weren&rsquo;t getting special characters from the title stripped out. This seemed to start around Wednesday this week, but I had only noticed it yesterday. It was only affecting two posts to begin with. But once I edited a previous post to add a link to the new post in the series, that post too was affected. Something in configuration was probably changed that I didn&rsquo;t have control over. I&rsquo;m sure it will get resolved, but in the meantime I needed to make some changes of my own so that readers weren&rsquo;t hitting 404s.</p>
<p>I added a few &ldquo;URL map&rdquo; entries to weblog config, so that anyone hitting the old URLs would get the posts. However, without remembering this happens, after saving the config, <em>ALL</em> weblog posts had their URLs updated, and any special characters in their titles were then in the URLs üò±. This was not good.</p>
<p>Luckily, I can manually add &ldquo;Location&rdquo; metadata for preferred paths to weblog posts, but I&rsquo;ve got a lot of posts! So that&rsquo;s how I spent my evening. I was fortunate to have had an Archive page open that I <em>DID NOT REFRESH</em> with the correct URLs to reference and diligently added a location path for every post. It was not a great night, but my weblog is not a spring chicken anymore, and there are some posts that get quite a bit of traffic. And it being NaBloPoMo, the blog is just getting hit more. I did not want a day that I was going to be away (today) to be full of people hitting 404s.</p>
<p>Everything seems stable now, and hopefully whatever config was causing the issue will get resolved. But between that and having the issue loading micro.blog I realized how attached I&rsquo;ve become to my blogs! I just had no idea how ten months of blogging has made me so reliant on that warm blanket. Yes, it&rsquo;s a comfort zone that I now rely on.</p>
<p>Just an interesting thing to consider.</p>

			 <p>It might be clich√© but I figured I&rsquo;d give this sort of post a shot this year. These are thoughts I&rsquo;ve had before but never written them down (or typed them, as be the case). Seems like the right kind of day, Thanksgiving, to document them.</p>
<p>I just wrapped up a three-part series on a subject that has been inside me and growing for the last five or six years. I consider it a first draft even though it is published on weblog. I do expect to revisit it and refine it over time. It was tough to write. It was sitting in Drafts since March or April and I just couldn&rsquo;t get a move-on finishing it.</p>
<p>It has been a tough few years, I think for everyone the world over. Sometimes I think people have a hard time sitting with their grief and really letting it take ahold of them. But I think that is an important process and it never goes as planned nor takes the time we expect it should. I consider the last five to six year of my life to be one rolling grief process, not all about one thing, and not all at the same time. It has felt like just as I was rounding the corner something else was there to surprise me again.</p>
<p>Through it all I&rsquo;ve been immensely grateful for my mother and father. At the beginning of the pandemic, for the first year, as I was still reeling with burnout from my job, I was only concerned about their well-being and keeping them alive until vaccines became available. During the second year I lost an uncle to Covid. My parents are still alive, though my mother&rsquo;s health is declining, due to factors unknown, though I have suspicions. However, I&rsquo;m thankful to still have a good relationship with them and be within driving distance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful I still have my home. Through this time I&rsquo;m not sure how I would have gotten by with my illness if I had to share space with anyone else who wasn&rsquo;t as careful as I need them to be. Not only as careful, but as honest as I would need them to be. People don&rsquo;t want to always share their carelessness or mistakes and that honesty is life or death to immunocompromised people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also grateful my home has the space for a garden. I have painted this garden like a canvas, every single plant I put in myself (or via the gardener I used to have help me when I was still working full-time and had less expendable time to spend working in the yard). Now I do it all myself, all maintenance, except for some of the trees I can&rsquo;t get to, which is really only the street trees and the neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree that hangs over my garage.</p>
<p>The garden has also been the thing that pulled me through burnout, the continuing pandemic, health issues, struggles with my aging parents, tribulations with city living, and a whole host of other things. Escaping into my garden is a joy that is irreplaceable, a salve that can calm even the worst of days.</p>
<p>Even though the climate is changing fast, I&rsquo;m thankful for the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s still mostly mild temperate climate, its immense beauty, and inviting outdoor activities. I&rsquo;m thankful and remorseful for those who came before us, who ceded land that they never believed they owned, for promises white man has never kept.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m mostly surrounded by open-minded liberals and a neighborhood of people that I get along with and look out for each other. And even though this country may be on the verge of something terrible if they don&rsquo;t make the right choice next year, I&rsquo;m thankful we can still mostly be called a democracy.</p>
<p>Finally, I am thankful I have found some joy in online activity after the past few years. That I still have hope that I could work in some capacity in tech or web development again, and that blogging has brought about a type of release, a space to find my voice and place on the web again. Thank you to both omg.lol and micro.blog and the Fediverse.</p>
<p>I hope you all have lovely and safe holidays with those you choose to surround yourselves with ü¶Éüíúüôè</p>

			 <p>One of my most &ldquo;popular&rdquo; posts on weblog (based on hit count) continues to be <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/07/on-micro-blog-and-how-i-want-to-use-it"><em>On micro.blog and how I want to use it.</em></a>. I&rsquo;m still not entirely sure how it continues to make the rounds, but it does. I also haven&rsquo;t even started to make a dent in all my wishes and dreams put forth in that post. I continue to plod away on todos on weblog, mostly.</p>
<p>I recently added the &ldquo;Reply by email&rdquo; plug-in on my microblog and setup email via my domain using Fastmail. I then proceeded to hesitatingly add a &ldquo;Reply by email&rdquo; link to the end of every weblog post and asked Adam to supply a UUID/unique variable available at the template level to set wildcard per-post email addresses to try to harness spam and source if or when it started to occur.</p>
<p>I got my <em>very first</em> email from weblog this morning and it was from that post! And it wasn&rsquo;t spam or harassment. In fact, it was thanking me for the post and saying that they had just signed up for Micro.blog because of it. How great is that?</p>

			 <p>Since around 2018 I&rsquo;ve put my Christmas tree up the same weekend the US turns its clocks back to Standard Time. That is usually around the first week in November and it heralds a dark time to come. This ritual is to ward off the dark time, it provides a warm glow in the corner of my &ldquo;great room&rdquo;‚Äînot actually a great room, but the living room and dining room that is only separated by a large opening as is common in Craftsman houses‚Äîthat I sorely need during the months ahead.</p>
<p>In Western Oregon and Washington, the dark months are dark due to shortened day length but also due to a brooding sky prone to drop water on us at any moment. Low hanging clouds can make even the middle of the day seem dark even if water isn&rsquo;t coming out of them. A clock that prematurely brings the day to an &ldquo;end&rdquo; at 4:30pm is almost unbearable. So I augment the day with false warmth and fake light.</p>
<p>This year I missed that weekend by nine days, but I got it up yesterday nonetheless. For the remainder of November I&rsquo;ll slowly bring up decorations and adornments and take my time putting trinkets and ribbon and garland all over the tree. I&rsquo;m not a giant Christmas fan, but something about this slow moving tradition, that I often spend by myself, is cathartic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a Christmas tree at all until I bought this house twelve years ago. So all the way from my mid-20s until my mid-30s I went without, except when visiting my parents. I lived in apartments, one of which was in a Pearl District tower surrounded by other large buildings, and faced north. That was a dark time indeed. For seven years I lived in that lovely cave and my well-being suffered from it. It faced the Weiden+Kennedy building and I remember one year they started putting a lights-only Christmas tree on the roof-top deck. That was my Christmas tree.</p>
<p>So now this slowly decorated tree will sit in a corner through November, December, and January, and won&rsquo;t come down until February, sometimes all the way until Valentine&rsquo;s Day. It has helped so much. I&rsquo;m even considering adding some exterior lights this year. I have a pre-lit garland for the front porch, but I&rsquo;m thinking of something different that I can see from my upstairs. My garage has a window facing out to the back yard and there is a plain unadorned grapevine wreath hanging on the inside of it. I want to string it up with lights and put it on a timer. The only people that will see it will be me and my immediate neighbors via their back yards. I sort of love that idea. Like a little secret circle of warmth.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s Some Day Note is also today&rsquo;s #NaBloPoMo entry and marks two weeks into the goal and two weeks since my last Note. Tomorrow is the halfway mark for posts and I haven&rsquo;t missed one yet‚Äîso here we go!</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m doing National Blog Posting Month! The <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/my-first-go-at-nablopomo">first post (1/30)</a> about why I&rsquo;m doing this thing is on weblog. I&rsquo;m tagging posts on weblog, but also keeping a &ldquo;tally&rdquo; of each one here via a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/nablopomo/">NaBloPoMo category</a>. Most posts so far are on weblog, but a few have made more sense to be on microblog.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/">Featured Photo posts</a> have resumed and I&rsquo;ll continue with that for a bit. Eventually I&rsquo;ll round out the <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/series/">series on Ceilings, Chandeliers, and Light Fixtures</a>, but I&rsquo;m enjoying the featured photo tradition of seeing what is featured each morning.</li>
<li>NaBloPoMo entry 2/30, <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/02/dynamicism.html">&ldquo;Dynamicism&rdquo;</a>, is on microblog and I go a little bit into what it is like to have a dynamic chronic illness.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/02/heck-yeah-a.html">watched <em>A Haunting in Venice</em></a> and really enjoyed it. I&rsquo;d been looking forward to it as I try to watch all the Agatha Christie adaptations for TV and screen.</li>
<li>I decided that part of NaBloPoMo would be to get through my backlog of <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/works-in-progress">Works in Progress</a> and entry 3/30 was one of them: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/brain-space">Brain space.</a></li>
<li>Another work-in-progress to tackle microformats on weblog ended up as a series and occupied entries 4/30 through 7/30 and then also 12/30. I had a lot of fun doing this one and plan on one final entry to get webmentions going on weblog too.

<li>For NaBloPoMo 10/30 I revisited a post and technique I&rsquo;d done using Flickr image sources: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/responsive-images-with-flickr-sources-a-walkthrough">Responsive images with Flickr sources: a walkthrough.</a></li>
<li>November is All The Leaves month in Portland and I&rsquo;ve been outside at least a couple times a week clearing off hard surfaces, pathways, gutters and drains. This past week I encountered a surprise and wrote about it with pictures for NaBloPoMo 11/30: <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/11/i-always-joke.html">I always joke about living in an urban jungle.</a></li>
<li>That brings us to yesterday&rsquo;s post, entry 13/30, which seems to have garnered a little attention, according to tinylytics. I&rsquo;m continuing to add to it, and it is one of those spur-of-the-moment posts that I just went with because I was having an executive function dysfunction day and after several attempts to start posts it was the only one that stuck: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">Types of Blog Posts.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that brings us to today! It has been a busy two weeks and hardly feels like two weeks have gone by since I last did one of these. By the time I do another one, NaBloPoMo will likely be over. Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>If I wanted to get serious about getting Backyard Bird Habitat certified, I probably could. I have all the sizes and types of birds. Big birds, little birds, tiny birds, hummingbirds. On any given day I see a half dozen to a dozen different species of bird in and around my yard in an inner city neighborhood about three miles from downtown, about one mile from a major river and Interstate highway.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today I was cleaning up some leaves. I intended to only do a little bit of work, but it stopped raining and was fairly pleasant, and being a holiday weekend, the neighborhood was a ghost town. So I ended up staying out there for 3.5 hours and cleared leaves off the front sidewalk and storm drain, the driveway, garage and patio gutters, patio (which had the most bizarre shaped accumulations of leaves blown in by wind this morning), and the area under the neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree between the garage and fence. Here, I encountered a surprise.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had been raking over there for a good ten minutes or so. I&rsquo;d formed several good sized piles, but something made me look up. I do recall seeing feather fuzz all about and thinking it was an odd time for molting. The fuzz was someone&rsquo;s brunch. I looked up into the apricot tree and not six feet away was a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk staring back at me, fresh catch in talons, feathers all over the large moss covered branch, and little bit of something on its beak.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was completely taken aback. I&rsquo;ve seen a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk twice around my yard. In fact, I just had a short conversation about this on Mastodon a week or so ago. The first encounter I was bent over in my front yard and just as I was standing up straight a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk was swooping over the top of me, recognized by its thickly banded tail feathers. The second encounter was in the back yard, I was upright this time, and it came straight out of the group of trees near the garages and torpedoed over the top of me, again very recognizable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This time the bird was caught off guard too. Like I said, the neighborhood was very quiet today, hardly any humans around. I remembered being upstairs and hearing the crows making a ruckus, they were definitely not happy with something and I first thought it might be a Red-tailed Hawk, which very often get mobbed by the crows from all around when they dare to land in a large tree. I think now it was the Cooper&rsquo;s, but the hawk still got its meal.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I managed to get some photos, because I don&rsquo;t think it quite knew what to do about me. I was very close and I don&rsquo;t think they see well at close distances. We were both in/under the tree so it was pretty dim light and I only had my iPhone, and not a very new one either. I talked to it for a little while and didn&rsquo;t make many quick moves, but I did go back and forth to my rolling compost bin to empty several buckets of leaves and it remained on the branch the entire time, though frozen and no longer eating its catch. Eventually I went around the back of the garage out of sight and when I came back it was gone.</p>

			 <p>I had some appointments this week and I took a little road trip into Washington. I visited family and went to my childhood home to see my parents. My mom had back surgery last week and has been having a rough recuperation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Normally, my visits would include a giant walk around their several acre garden, but that wasn&rsquo;t in the cards for her this time. However, with the outstanding fall color the PNW is experiencing this year, I took the circuitous route around the garden alone, and captured some very pretty and somewhat morose photographs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Morose because every time I go visit is a reminder that my parents will not be around forever, that I can&rsquo;t stay in Portland much longer, and that I will end up back at that house with them until they die. It is all so insurmountable and hard to comprehend. It took so much out of me to leave that place. Not just the house, I had already left there. But that town, that county, everything about it is wrapped up in a history that is <em>no longer me</em> and needing to go back makes me feel like part of the <em>me now</em> will die.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I still have no idea what this will look like. I don&rsquo;t know if I can finish work on my house, drawing on savings and retirement, and rent it until a future time that I could come back. Or if I need to make a clean break and sell it, not knowing what that future will look like, or how hard it would be to manage a back-and-forth for any period of time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As much as I love the location and immediate surroundings of my parents' house and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind <em>being there</em> I don&rsquo;t want to be in that town. It&rsquo;s a very backwards place with very little to offer and a whole lot of the yucky-ness that is plaguing the US right now. The world, right now. If I break all ties with Portland, there&rsquo;s no way I can financially come back later. I&rsquo;d have to keep the house I have now in order to come back later.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Like I said, insurmountable decisions my head just swims with all there is to plan and execute. Please enjoy these photos from the day in the garden.</p>

			 <p>Heck yeah! <em>A Haunting in Venice</em> is on Hulu. I will be watching this and it is looking far more horror-like than I normally tolerate. But how do I <em>not</em> watch a modern making of a Poirot? I&rsquo;ve enjoyed all the other remakes of this vintage with Kenneth Branagh portraying Poirot, so I guess I must.</p>

			 <p>Today is a much different day than yesterday. Yesterday my body woke up around 4:45am and by 5am I was ready for coffee. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;going back to sleep&rdquo; and no more excuses, just give me coffee.</p>
<p>While in the kitchen, I decided, as I listened to podcasts and sipped coffee, to prep everything I needed for making my favorite potato soup. That&rsquo;s a fair bit of chopping and collecting of mise en place. And then, at barely 7am I was already making the soup.</p>
<p>By 8:30am I had a giant pot of soup going into the refrigerator and I was sitting down at my computer absorbing all the things. I launched into deciding to participate in NaBloPoMo and wrote my first entry. I collected my weekly grocery delivery from the porch box, made a giant salad for lunch, and had two slices of pumpkin pie. It was now early afternoon.</p>
<p>You might be thinking &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo; The big deal is, that is unusual activity. I&rsquo;m not bipolar. I&rsquo;m not depressed. I don&rsquo;t knowingly have ADHD or autism, though some parts of my condition do overlap. But I do have another invisible, and quite dynamic, chronic illness. And today I&rsquo;m paying the price for that gusto of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had ME/CFS for the better part of my 47 years. As a child and teen I was quick and smart, outgoing, and participated in many school and community sports, as well as took long hiking and cycling trips with my father, uncles, and cousins.</p>
<p>In grade school I kicked ass in every year&rsquo;s athletic competence tests, beating all the boys. I was in advanced courses and made straight A&rsquo;s in school all the way to my junior year in HS when everything changed. Some time in the years preceding that change I had a virus, probably Mononucleosis (EBV).</p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t necessarily intended to be a history of my illness, though bits of that will naturally come out. Instead, this post is a revelation of my dynamicism and how hard it is to exist in a world that expects so much sameness. Most of the time people won&rsquo;t see or sometimes hear from me on my worst days. This is less to do with hiding and much more to do with capability. As such, when I am seen or heard from it is usually when I&rsquo;m most capable. This leads to the expectation that I&rsquo;m always capable.</p>
<p>But my illness has conditions. Conditions within conditions. It is always a trade-off, everything I do. How much of this can I do without spending the next three days to a week paying for it? What plans do I have that are non-negotiable vs what lovely weather we have today and I want to spend all of it in the garden? Can I do a giant grocery order and use every spoon I&rsquo;ve saved as well as many spoons I might need into the next couple weeks just so I can feed myself?</p>
<p>The world is hard. I wish people would just believe other people. I have spent many years fighting off gaslighting and disbelief. Being brushed aside as lazy or incompetent. Mostly fueled by the limited exposure many of us with this illness give to the wider world. We spend a lot of time alone. Many of us have been abandoned by family and friends. Even those that stick around don&rsquo;t always &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and trying to educate anyone is one of the hardest things. That is taking spoons I might need to vacuum my house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll write more about this. It won&rsquo;t be a straight line and will meander, but with the state of a still-continuing pandemic and ever growing cohort of Long Covid sufferers, even those getting an ME/CFS diagnosis, it&rsquo;s important to talk about this much maligned and ignored condition. Be gracious and understanding with each other. We are dynamic and deserve love and respect.</p>

			 <p>Time for another Some Day Note! It&rsquo;s been a longer period than the last few, not sure why that is. Nothing particularly interesting or exciting happened, but let&rsquo;s see what I have for you today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Something I mentioned doing in the last note, I started a photoblogging <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/series/">series on Ceilings, Chandeliers, and Light Fixtures</a>. I&rsquo;m on a little break as I resume some <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/">Featured Photo posts</a>, but there are more to come.</li>
<li>I made a short trip to visit family. My mom is having back surgery today and I wanted to get up there to see them before that time, as I&rsquo;m not sure how she&rsquo;ll progress afterwards and through the holidays.</li>
<li>Portland had a very <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/25/we-are-in.html">early frost/freeze this year</a>. In my zip code the average first frost date is November 22, so this came almost four weeks early. The garden didn&rsquo;t really flinch and we&rsquo;re back to mild temps and rain into next week.</li>
<li>I talked a bit about the top floor in my house that I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/25/the-treehouse-lair.html">treehouse lair</a> and how my plans and usage for the space have evolved over a decade living here.</li>
<li>The leaf raking season is getting into full swing. I only really clear off hard surfaces (and gutters) and mostly leave them on the garden beds (though not smothering plants). Once the rains really set in and the leaves start to break down, I do clear some of them out of the garden beds in order to avoid harboring diseases that can affect the crowns of some plants in our overly wet winter climate.</li>
<li>The birds are back in the yard and I&rsquo;m so happy to see them. We have juncos year round but they tend to go to higher elevations during the heat of summer. But now I have them and: song sparrows, goldfinches, house finches, chickadees, bushtits&hellip;OH MY! The best season for birds.</li>
<li>Speaking of birds, I took one of my cars into the DEQ last week and the station I went to is next to a slough on the Columbia River and partially surrounded by a thick tree canopy. While waiting in line next to a single tree in the middle of the paved area next to the waiting lanes I saw a female downy woodpecker! She was only about six feet from my open car window, but of course I didn&rsquo;t get a picture, she flew away as the car in front of me pulled forward.</li>
<li>Yesterday I published <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/taking-a-hit">a post on weblog</a> about the feature I suggested to Vincent for Tinylytics, and included a hearty thank you to all indie developers.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m back to working on integrating microformats into weblog after <a href="https://front-end.social/@kizu/111323635099097300">an update from @kizu</a> about doing the same during IndieWebCamp this week. I really got into this in the spring and started documenting what I was learning and doing in a post, but somehow got delayed. Back to it (and a post!)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also resuming a personal post on work and the state of the web. I&rsquo;m prompted to revisit this after several blog posts and a conference talk made the rounds recently. It&rsquo;s been hard to write but I think finishing it will be cathartic for me and hopefully others.</li>
<li>This coming weekend is the clock setback for Daylight Saving Time in the US. As is tradition for me since around 2018, I will be putting up my Christmas tree. This began as a way to ward off the dark sads, not because I&rsquo;m a huge Christmas fan. I&rsquo;ll take the month of November to get it decorated, I&rsquo;m not particularly in a hurry, and then it will stay up until around Valentine&rsquo;s day next year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m missing something, but it would make more sense, or would be nice, if a draft post would not create the URL scheme (ie, date/month) until the post is published. Otherwise you end up with a path that does not possibly match the published date. Is this right? Is there another way?</p>

<p>As I recall, this was tough to get contrast on. I was facing into a bright cloudy white sky, the field was in the shade, and the large bank of trees dark against the sky. A little tweaking brought out a bit of contrast.</p>

			 <p>My upstairs is transitional. When I bought the house, the two rooms were finished: one room had tacky paneling and was basically a very large room for storage with two porthole windows over the front porch; the back room was a nicely finished bedroom with carpet, plaster walls, a nice sized walk-in closet and three large windows facing out over the backyard. But none of it was climate controlled, updated, or ecological.</p>
<p>When I had a whole home energy upgrade in the first couple years of living here, I had them tear it all out. Replaced all the windows with energy efficient windows. Updated all the electrical. Had the old furnace chimney dismantled all the way down three floors to the basement and ran updated HVAC up (there was zero previous heating/cooling on the top floor prior). And had spray foam and rigid foam insulation installed throughout.</p>
<p>So, the area up there is more comfortable than it ever was before, though it is &ldquo;technically&rdquo; not finished anymore due to there being no sheetrock or other wall surface. The original wood floor in the &ldquo;bedroom&rdquo; part has been revealed under the carpet that was there. The stairwell is tongue and groove wood panelling, which I really like and wouldn&rsquo;t mind having all the way into the bedroom. The framing for the closet is still in place, and I have all the original doors and hardware still. It really just needs wall covering and window trim.</p>
<p>This is now a priority as in the subsequent years I have started using the space more and more. I first started using it as an office away from my home office on the ground floor. Mostly to &ldquo;get away&rdquo;, as it is so quiet up there and it gives a different perspective facing out the back of the house over the trees. Also, as the magnolia tree that I planted in 2013 has become a Real Tree now, it really does feel like a treehouse up there and I quite love it.</p>
<p>Lately, over the course of the pandemic, being home more and more, I started sleeping up there too. Mostly during the winter since I love hearing the rain on the roof. My bedroom in my childhood home was upstairs too and that is a sound I miss hearing at night. I made the bedroom into a &ldquo;guest room&rdquo; with a twin bed that I use when I sleep up there and I usually get some of the best sleep when I&rsquo;m up there.</p>
<p>What I was waiting on was funds to push out a dormer and install a master bath above the main floor bath, before finishing the walls and trim. But that may be unlikely in my current financial situation as well as the length of time I might remain here, which is unknown. It is still likely that could be done, but finishing the space as it is is priority now: walls and trim, paint, light fixtures, finish wood floors. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do anything with the other room than leave it as storage for now.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been sleeping up there, though, I wanted for some privacy, even though it is unlikely there is anyone able to see in. I do look across to my neighbor&rsquo;s upstairs dormer, but I can&rsquo;t see into it so I doubt they can see into mine across the distance of our two backyards combined. Still, I decided to rig something up today. I put up some Command hooks and took a clean drop cloth and used four binder clips (I&rsquo;m still amazed that I come up with new uses for these‚Äîso versatile!) and have a rough privacy curtain but can still see out the top half of the double hung window in the middle when standing. I sort of love it.</p>

			 <p>Capturing the YouTube videos for the Sellwood Bridge move and construction time-lapses because I feel like I&rsquo;m looking them up from time-to-time.</p>
<p>This is definitely part of my history of living in Portland. I used to work in John&rsquo;s Landing off Macadam and spent time in Sellwood often, and watched the progress of the bridge degrade before the county went through this move and replacement process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to understand the history of the Sellwood Bridge and how it was always undersized and poorly constructed was tied to Portland&rsquo;s very history of wealth and corruption.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s really interesting how critical tech users are of any seeming hiccup in the Apple ecosystem, when we know other ecosystems have just as many issues, sometimes blatantly obvious ones that are not even addressed.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve given a short update in a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/08/it-feels-good.html">recent micro.blog post</a> but I&rsquo;m due for an updated Some Day Note, so here I am! What do I have for you today?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m considering a <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/09/looking-for-photos.html">new mini photo series</a> on my microblog. This came about from seeing a post by <a href="https://its.puddingtime.org/2023/10/09/camped-at-nehalem.html">@mph</a> about his recent stop at Camp 18 and he shared more photos from over the years. This had me searching for my photos from Camp 18 and I eventually used &ldquo;chandelier&rdquo; as a search term in Photos and now want to share all my glorious ceilings, chandeliers, and light fixtures, from lots of places, which I have far more of than I expected. More on this to come!</li>
<li>I finished my <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/manual-of-me">Manual of Me</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working on this for quite a while, probably more therapy for myself than something for anyone else to gain value from, but who knows. If I ever hope to work again, outside of health limitations that may endure, I need to get back into a headspace that I haven&rsquo;t been in for some time. I think working through these sections and thinking back to what challenges I had at my last job and what I would hope to get from a new job was an important step.</li>
<li>I wrote an <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a> for weblog. This was something I had been considering adding but was recently prompted to get it done in order to feel right in joining the <a href="https://a11y-webring.club/">a11y-webring.club</a> organized by accessibility advocate and developer, <a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a>.</li>
<li>On that note: I joined the webring and I want to join more! <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/webrings#webring-invite">Invite me to your webring!</a></li>
<li>As part of preparing my Accessibility Statement, I ran through an accessibility audit using the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool</a> provided by WebAIM on all weblog template pages and important landing and one-off pages. Afterwards I made several important CSS and config updates and improvements, some of which had been on my list for several months.</li>
<li>I had a &ldquo;tiny&rdquo; üòÅ (and related to the previous entries) tinylytics drama again. I discovered a few dozen hits from what I assumed was somebody or something trying to find a vulnerability on weblog via a path that doesn&rsquo;t exist (and therefore results in a 404): <code>/data/getpage.php</code>. I reported this to Vincent, requesting the hits be removed and suggested some way via the admin to flag further hits for removal. Because Vincent is great and always helpful, he informed me that the origin of the hits was WebAIM‚Äîmy fault all along! He had already removed the hits, but now I know when they show up again where they&rsquo;re coming from. In the future there will be some admin tool for specifying hit paths to ignore. That&rsquo;s a great feature that I can see being very useful.</li>
<li>I listened to a really great episode of <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/586/">Shop Talk Show</a> interviewing Manton about micro.blog and I&rsquo;m again on the edge of wanting to upgrade my subscription to premium. Soon.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re fast approaching mid-October when the real rainy season can be relied on. A welcome turn as the rain is back in Portland this week after another hot spell last week when temps went into the mid-80s again.</li>
<li>Despite this temperature hiccup, I am gearing up to do winter containers on the patio. This is always a cathartic ritual of tearing out my summer annuals and putting in pansies and violas that will continue all the way through until spring, bringing color and blooms off-and-on through the dark days. These blooms are not only popular with me, but also &ldquo;my&rdquo; hummingbirds, as I&rsquo;ve discovered them drinking from them often.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m finally getting close to selling one of my cars. It&rsquo;s a boring story about why I have two cars, which I obviously do not need as someone not even working full-time right now, and even when I was, I worked from home for the five years prior. While I was filling out some tools online for valuation I inadvertently added the mileage of my other vehicle, but when I tried to correct it was not allowed to due to some <em>other</em> mileage the tool claimed to have knowledge of‚Äîwhere is that mileage coming from? I&rsquo;m not sure and am bothered by the need to call some entity to correct it. That will have to be dealt with though&hellip;üòí I am the only owner of the car so I can&rsquo;t imagine.</li>
<li>I have some Arlo security cameras that need replaced. They are no longer supported by Arlo, though at least Arlo was persuaded from completely bricking them after customer uproar. But they also require batteries and do not tie-into HomeKit, which I am quite fond of nowadays. I settled on some indoor <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us">Eve Home</a> cameras. I&rsquo;ve only had them set up for a few days but am already liking the improved video quality and the automatic mode switching that occurs via Home members coming and going. They also use Apple Secure Video which is stored in iCloud.</li>
<li>So glad that the baking and soup season is upon us! I made an <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/06/i-wanted-to.html">ad hoc soup</a> last week to celebrate despite the hot weather and it turned out to be delicious. I would make it again!</li>
<li>My weblog post <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/the-picture-element-for-unexpected-art-direction">&ldquo;The picture element for unexpected art direction.&quot;</a> made it in <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@fridayfrontend/111211790282638825">Friday Front-End</a>! I am both humbled and horrified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another note with quite a few entries, I suppose that&rsquo;s enough for now‚Äîtake care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I wrapped up my longtime coming <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/manual-of-me">Manual of Me</a>. Earlier in the week I wrote an <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a> and joined the <a href="https://a11y-webring.club/">a11y-webring.club</a>. I‚Äôve also been working on my list of updates and fixes, both in config and CSS.</p>
<p>My next big task is refactoring the theme switcher to make it more accessible, store the user‚Äôs choice for future visits, and to incorporate the uses of the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element for swapping light/dark images based on <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>. The last part is a follow-up to a recent post: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/the-picture-element-for-unexpected-art-direction">The picture element for unexpected art direction.</a></p>
<p>After mostly focusing on micro.blog lately, I‚Äôve missed what I really consider my home base. Though, I am finding that when I want to post something on Mastodon, but I can‚Äôt decide which of my four accounts it belongs on, that‚Äôs when I put it on micro.blog.</p>
<p>Nice to be finding a groove.</p>

			 <p>Though the weather certainly does not call for it, it is fall and I insist. Soup is probably my favorite food, along with a good casserole or pasta dish or everything deli sandwich or breakfast burrito. There&rsquo;s a pattern here. I like dishes with a lot in them. Many textures, flavors, hearty. I like my salads the same way. Pasta salads too.</p>
<p>I sorely need to go grocery shopping but thought I could cobble together an &ldquo;Anything Goes Italian Soup&rdquo; with what I had on hand. I found about 2/3 cup pearled barley, a couple cans of cannellini beans, a large can of San Marzano whole-peeled tomatoes, an onion, 1/2 head of minced garlic, carrots/broccoli/power greens, red pepper flakes, salt and fresh ground black pepper, and a healthy dose of Italian seasoning.</p>

<p>I think it looks great, we&rsquo;ll see how it tastes. It should last me a few days, but some of it may end up in the freezer for a rainy day, or a dull day this winter, or just when I&rsquo;m out of spoons to make anything else.</p>

<p>Edit: it needed a little something, I topped with balsamic vinegar, and that did it üòã</p>

			 <p>Finally finished a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/the-picture-element-for-unexpected-art-direction">weblog post</a> yesterday, after starting and stopping work on it over the past few weeks. It wasn&rsquo;t long or hard, but it was involved and included call-outs via Mastodon posts from seeking a solution to a technical problem and finding that we can still rely on each other sometimes.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m trying to write an Accessibility Statement for weblog in order to join another webring. This was prompted by posting that I was going to add a line to my <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/webrings">Webrings page</a> seeking more webrings to join. I asked if that would seem desperate, so far the jury is hung on that üòÜ</p>
<p>What do these two things have in common? They involve other humans, and anything involving other humans makes the task that much harder. I wanted to write that weblog post in the most respectful way that I&rsquo;d be sure to attribute the right people and information (something as of this morning I&rsquo;m still not entirely confident of!) Writing an accessibility statement is both opening myself up to criticism from other people, but also laying bare my doubts that I even know what I think I know!</p>
<p>Layered on top of the difficulty writing already holds, it is no wonder we can sit on in-progress work for long periods of time and sometimes never publish it. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t intend for this little post to be in depth. I just wanted to acknowledge the human-ness we all face even in places we might not have thought to be so human.</p>

			 <p>This is the narrow side yard that used to be entirely grass prior to 2021. I had all the grass removed and a basalt stone path put in with river rock running up to a narrow planting bed. I chose the plants and put them in myself in August of 2021, so this is two years old.</p>
<p>Looking in the opposite direction to an area I call &ldquo;behind the berm&rdquo; where some shade plants and hydrangeas live. The hydrangeas are entering their best season, in my opinion, when the take on their fall color. Those bloom heads are not the summer flowering color but the more mauve to red they take on before turning nearly burgundy. The leaves will go from green to yellow to orange to red as well. The multi-trunk tree on the right is my magnolia.</p>

			 <p>Without really planning it, the some day note seems to occur about every two weeks. That&rsquo;s about the right regularity for me without trying too hard, so I&rsquo;m happy with how that&rsquo;s working out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall! Portland and the PNW has entered fall, both on the calendar but also &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo;. Starting this past weekend, the very first atmospheric river of the season came right at us and produced three days of fairly substantial rainfall. I know a lot of people in this country and around the world like to stereotype Portland (and Seattle) as raining all the time, but that simply is not true. And lately with climate change, it is even less true. Measurable rain is anything above 1/10th of an inch. Since April 25, 2023, there have only been five days of measurable rain in Portland. That is five months of basically no rain, not rain all the time, folks. This time of year we actually yearn for rain. We&rsquo;ve just endured months and months of drought and wildfire, hot weather and dry yards. So I always come back to an essay from about ten years ago written by a guy in Seattle called &ldquo;Ready For Rain&rdquo;. It was originally <a href="https://leelefever.medium.com/ready-for-rain-f14703d4f4a8">published on Medium</a>, but he seems to have moved it to <a href="https://leelefever.com/inspiration-ready-for-rain/">his own site</a> now as well.</li>
<li>I earned my last remaining two Microblog pins: Micro Monday and Night Owl! Completely meaningless, but hey, we have to aim for something in life, right?</li>
<li>Before those last two pins, I still needed to earn the pin for Bookshelves, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d ever get. I read, but it is very sporadic with my illness, trying to keep track of anything I read is like shooting in the dark. My available spoons and ability to withstand visual stress like reading an entire book is not worth it much of the time. However, I was seeking a hummingbird book that I had been trying to get my hands on, and while hoping to find it available on Libby through Multnomah County Library, ended up finding and reading <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/finished-reading-fastest.html">Fastest Things on Wings</a>. What a fulfilling experience that was.</li>
<li>I watched all of season two and three (except for the last episode, yet to come out as of this writing) of Reservation Dogs. The episode called &ldquo;Elora&rsquo;s Dad&rdquo; was excellent and I made <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/ethan-hawke-as.html">a small post</a> about it.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/18/i-deactivated-my.html">I deactivated my Twitter account</a>. It was beyond time. The platform is more of a cesspool than it has ever been and rather a security risk. I&rsquo;m not going to harp on anyone who still uses it but folks really need to be aware of the exposure it puts on you and your information. Since Musk took over, I have had more spam and fraud on my mobile number and associated email address used by that Twitter account than ever before. I know it is from being on that account because I don&rsquo;t share this number or address with very many people. All of the content you put on there has been leaked and given to bad actors and you better believe it will probably come back to haunt you if they can get something out of it. Musk is a bad man that supports efforts to destroy democracies and support autocracies. You shouldn&rsquo;t want to be a part of that.</li>
<li>I read about <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/16/a-brief-history.html">Digital Gardens</a> in an older blog post by Maggie Appleton. It is excellent and prompted me to <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/works-in-progress">write about what I&rsquo;m writing about</a>, what I have in progress and want to finish.</li>
<li>I joined the Tinylytics webring on weblog and fought with my small-town credit union over the monthly fraud alert saga ensuing from the recurring foreign transaction to pay Tinylytics. Vincent is amazing and has worked with me to get this right and I&rsquo;m now just going to pay him upfront for a whole year and avoid this headache. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the grandfathered very low fixed APR on this card I wouldn&rsquo;t put up with it. But this rate is basically unheard of anymore, and I&rsquo;ve had the card since I was 18 (30 years).</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/14/saw-this-post.html">Wordpress now has an ActivityPub plugin</a> to make a blog compatible with the Fediverse and provide comments that will work as replies. I&rsquo;ve not only discovered that I already have a Wordpress.com account and blog (I never did much with it), but I also have a Wordpress blog on my ancient domain/hosting that I haven&rsquo;t used since I was in college, yet still pay for. So now I have gears working in my head for another &ldquo;thing&rdquo; though not sure what yet. Do I need <em>another</em> blog?! Maybe this is where my newsletter will end up? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more to say on this at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a long one, thanks for sticking around. Take care and have a great week!</p>

			 <p>I view most Apple software updates as ways for performance to worsen on my devices so much that I‚Äôm forced to upgrade the devices. I‚Äôm starting to tire of this ecosystem for just that reason. It isn‚Äôt sustainable, monetarily or environmentally. But the alternatives don‚Äôt interest me either. Life in the woods as an internet/device free hermit does, however.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yeah, this happens to come the day Sonoma is released, but I&rsquo;m remiss to upgrade my 2019 MacBook Pro. I may on my slightly newer iMac, but not sure yet. I like to keep systems consistent. And since my iPhone, which is newer than my iPad, isn&rsquo;t supported for iOS17, I probably will not upgrade my iPad even though it is supported, especially considering how poorly my newest Apple hardware (four HomePod Minis) have performed with their upgrades. Though not necessarily a speed issue, the software just sucks. Siri is worse than ever.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d like to know the decision matrix that landed on Ethan Hawke as Elora&rsquo;s dad. Indeed, I did not, have not, had an absent father in my life, though I&rsquo;ve known many who have. And even more who&rsquo;ve had a present father of questionable contribution.</p>
<p>But this episode made me cry off and on, throughout. There&rsquo;s something refreshing and endearing about a father, even an absent one, admitting his every fault that even one that is always present, but can never admit his faults, cannot possess.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780544416031">Fastest Things on Wings</a> by Teresa E. Masear üìö</p>
<p>I suppose I should say something more than what I put in replies on the &ldquo;Started reading&rdquo; post for this book. But I&rsquo;m honestly not sure I could put into words anything better than what the author said is a few paragraphs near the end. It particularly struck me at this time in my life while I look around at a world throwing everything away that we&rsquo;ve learned about public health, keeping each other safe, and strides we&rsquo;ve made in protecting the vulnerable, in pursuit of some false freedom and short-sighted sense of &ldquo;normality&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hear this kind of anthropocentric smugness a lot in rehab. Some people insist that individual humans are more important than members of all other species and therefore they do not believe that injured wildlife, even something as wondrous and amazing as a hummingbird, should be rescued. The survival-of-the-fittest argument goes something like this: (1) animals live in nature; (2) nature is a big sorting mechanism that weeds out the weak, which are meant to die, while the strong go on to perpetuate the species; (3) saving the weak propagates a less robust species that ultimately will create the need for more rehab and so on; and, finally, (4) rescuing several hundred hummingbirds every year means nothing in the big scheme of things.</p>
<p>As a young graduate student in my early twenties with no clear career plan, I studied ancient Greek philosophy and spent three years teaching Aristotelian logic to hundreds of exceedingly illogical college undergraduates. Hence my answer to the natural-selection proponents in relation to hummingbird rescue is (1) there is nothing natural about Los Angeles; (2) young hummingbirds who end up in rehab after their nests get cut out of trees to clear the way for an unobstructed view of the city/hillside/ocean whatever are not constitutionally weaker than those born far from such urban threats and don&rsquo;t deserve to die; (3) some of the strongest, fastest, and most striking birds I have released started out at a disadvantage but nonetheless will produce offspring as physically impressive as any hummingbird on earth; and, finally, (4) next time you are lying in the hospital facing certain death without medical intervention, ask yourself (and this requires brutal honesty) how important your life really is in the big scheme of things. If you have trouble with this last question, try imagining the minuscule planet we inhabit from across the universe, from a vantage point, say, a hundred million light-years away, keeping in mind the immense sweep of history and the billions of humans who have inhabited the earth before you. If, after this philosophical exercise, you are still convinced of your relative importance in the universe, seek help.</p>

			 <p>After seeing <a href="https://micro.blog/Annie">@Annie</a>‚Äôs photo challenge today I found a YouTube video of a place I used to swim and get in trouble near my hometown called Hollywood Gorge. There were always (unfortunately) casualties from people jumping in from the high rocks across the river on a similar outcropping to her picture.</p>
<p>If you are at all interested, here‚Äôs a video of the little gorge, there‚Äôs a decent set of rapids that folks like to run when the water is high during late winter and spring. In the video at the end of the rapids near the beach is where the water is deep and the rocks across from the beach is where people jump in:</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure it was private property at the time we used to go out there, but I‚Äôm fairly certain it is a no-trespassing-tolerated private property now, unless you access the gorge from above via water. A lot of areas near my hometown are like that now. Something we took for granted when I was a kid/teen were endless logging roads and trails and if you had a truck you could get anywhere because they weren‚Äôt gated off back then. People ruin everything and over the years trash and vandalism as well as under-age drinking and drugs on private yet accessible land put an end to that.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm now curious how this might also be able to integrate with micro.blog. For example, following a WordPress blog here and similarly being able to reply and have it show up as a comment, nearly identical to micro.blog. Am I off base? Surely they‚Äôre using Webmentions as well.</p>

			 <p>I think I&rsquo;ve had some successes over the last few weeks, or at least my brain has the view that I have. That&rsquo;s gotta be worth something, even if it is erroneous üòÜ</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what I can come up with on today&rsquo;s installment of Some Day Notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m participating in the <a href="https://micro.blog/discover/mbsept/grid">September micro.blog photo challenge</a>. I participated in the March challenge as well, earlier this year, but that was before I &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; I had a micro.blog and started using it. In March I relied largely on my library of photos. This time around I am trying to take contemporary photos, while still relying somewhat on my library.</li>
<li>I added one of my favorite recipes to weblog, where I occasionally document them with my favorite additions and modifications. This time around it is <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/08/creamy-baked-potatoes">Creamy Baked Potatoes</a> with a time-tested slew of seasonings that will knock your socks off during bake time, the smell is amazing.</li>
<li>I also published a new weblog post, though it is related to a previous post, in that I had intended to expand on a subject mentioned and then forgot. This is about <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/adding-microblogging-feeds-to-weblog">Adding microblogging feeds to weblog</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been revisiting some Agatha Christie adaptations for TV and film. A few of them are what are being referred to as &ldquo;Alternative History Dramas&rdquo; that I cannot help but roll my eyes at. At least one of them was worthwhile.</li>
<li>I made another trip to visit family last week. It was nothing remarkable but any time I can visit my aging parents is worthwhile in my book. Each time it is made clear that I will need to move closer to them sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>We have turned the corner on the seasons in Portland, at least temporarily, as it seems we will get back into the 90s by next weekend. The brief reprieve was nice while it lasted.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been growing my Mastodon accounts. Though not something I purposefully strive for, one of my smaller and more personal accounts that I primarily use for talking about my chronic illness has seen more activity in the last couple weeks than in the previous eight months I&rsquo;ve had it. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence, as we are in yet another surge of the virus and that always makes content there more abundant and worthy of sharing and talking about. It remains one of the safest spaces on the internet for me.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also been writing some sporadic&hellip;poems? They&rsquo;re more like rhythmic thoughts, but I&rsquo;m only publishing them to microblog and not the timeline. They&rsquo;re fairly personal and I&rsquo;m not even sure how I want to capture them long-term. I will probably need to create a category and page some day.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s it for now. Take care and have a great week!</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> Well, in that case, I‚Äôm afraid my answer‚Äôs quite short. You can‚Äôt.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> There isn‚Äôt a golf club I know that would commission a design from a woman. I understand there has been a trend of late for ladies to golf. But really, the sheer complexity of a designer‚Äôs task is beyond the capabilities of a woman, no matter how capable that woman is.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Oh, I see. I hadn‚Äôt realized. But thinking about it, how could I have been so stupid? Imagine a woman being able to design the preamble to putting something small in a hole. A woman might just present the hole and have done. And where would be the fun in that? There‚Äôd be nothing to groom, for a start. But thank you for your time. It‚Äôs been pointless.</p>

			 <p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to be able to fully participate in this month&rsquo;s photoblogging challenge. There may be sporadic days I do, but I was planning to be able to complete the entirety with new pictures every day rather than relying on my library. But that&rsquo;s not reality with my current health and necessary life activities at this time. I&rsquo;m still hoping that I will be awarded the 30-day photo challenge pin for my streak of Featured Photos, but no such luck yet. I look forward to seeing everyone else&rsquo;s photos though!</p>
<hr>
<p>So, I got <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/01/day-abstract-greghiggins.html">Day 1</a> done, and my new challenge for myself is: if I can&rsquo;t get out to take a new photo, but I can muster trodding around my giant house or getting out into my garden/garage/yard, do it. I bought new camera batteries specifically to use this camera for microblogging, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

			 <p>The potato casserole I put in the oven has one of the most delectable aroma of herbs/spices. I‚Äôve been riffing on this recipe for a while and I like this combo (by smell) the best so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>salt &amp; pepper</li>
<li>smoked paprika</li>
<li>granulated garlic</li>
<li>ground nutmeg</li>
<li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still trying to be okay with sharing the good and the bad. It always feels like sharing the bad becomes a turn-off for people and chases them away. This is a sickness in our society. If you&rsquo;re so fragile that you can&rsquo;t handle the reality of other people&rsquo;s pain, well, perhaps you are the one that is not playing your part in this society.</p>
<p>On that note, here is today&rsquo;s installment of Some Day Notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>We made it through the (latest) heatwave‚ÄîPortland, OR, has now reached and/or exceeded 108¬∞ F <em>four</em> times since records began, all since 2021.</li>
<li>I had a meltdown related to my exasperation of trying to survive in a world that doesn&rsquo;t want me or other chronically ill people to exist. My exasperation on this front continues as the world just digs its collective heels deeper in the sand as more join the chronically ill ranks despite protestations that the virus is over.</li>
<li>I visited family on the weekend, something I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep up with every couple weeks. It&rsquo;s very hard and takes a lot out of me, most social events do, in addition to the travel time it takes.</li>
<li>I completed another micro.blog challenge (post a photo every day for 30 days), though have yet to receive the pin‚Äîapparently it only automatically gets awarded if the photos are &ldquo;short posts&rdquo; and a few of mine ended up being long, because <em>words</em>.</li>
<li>Wildfires in the NW ensconced the metro area in poor air quality for the last several days. I&rsquo;ve been holed up in my office cuddling an air purifier and still have a scratchy throat. We are hoping it clears out later today.</li>
<li>The noise from one of my neighbors, which I thought was because they had suddenly adopted 4-5 dogs appears to be because they&rsquo;ve been functioning as a dog-boarding facility at a residential house using an online platform and I suspect they have not gotten licensed nor paid the fees required by Multnomah County. I&rsquo;ll let one of my other neighbors deal with this if they want to. Seems many are annoyed by the noise and disruption. It&rsquo;s (not) a lot of fun to have random dogs that don&rsquo;t live here barking at you while in your own yard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I have more to say, but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now. I haven&rsquo;t blogged much in more than a week due to &ldquo;hardships&rdquo; which have a real toll on my cognition, pain threshold, and ability to write. The heatwave and wildfire smoke haven&rsquo;t helped either. Really hoping by the next note I&rsquo;ll have written something, or worked more on my styleguide, or made progress on my micro.blog theme/cross-posting, or my newsletter&hellip;or really anything, there&rsquo;s a lot to do!</p>

<p>My take on weekly (or weakly üòè which I really like but don&rsquo;t want to steal) or &ldquo;x things&rdquo; notes, but giving me the not-tied-to-a-day flexibility that I desire.

<li>I added a web app manifest with icons and favicons to weblog and <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/08/web-app-manifest-destiny">wrote about it</a> on weblog.</li>
<li>I crashed twice this week, a bumpy week of activity, and my body felt it.</li>
<li>Portland is heading into another heatwave starting today, and a red flag warning as we will experience high winds, high heat (nearly a week of 100+ temps), and extremely low levels of relative humidity.</li>
<li>I renewed registration on one car, now ready to sell the other after I detail it.</li>
<li>This week will mark one month of (active!!) use on micro.blog!</li>

			 <p>It seems to me that if SCOTUS deems a web designer&rsquo;s craft so personal and possessive that they can deny service to a protected class, &ldquo;ruling that the state of Colorado cannot compel the designer to create work that violates her values,&rdquo; that same web designer&rsquo;s craft, or another web designer, or a web developer, etc, should be protected from AI scraping that could end up distorting or using it in a way that &ldquo;violates her values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly, AI in general violates my values.</p>
<p>Remember, the scenario was completely hypothetical. The designer had not even been asked to do this yet. So in the similar manner, a designer being scraped could do this as a hypothetical, I guess. That is, not show standing, as ridiculous as that sounds and is.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a weird curse of growing up GenX. One small part of it for me is the unfortunate recurrence of catching horrific events in our country&rsquo;s history live on TV. I don&rsquo;t know if other generations also feel this.</p>
<p>I decided to write up a short list that I can recall tonight, after just watching the season three opener of The West Wing, released in October 2001.</p>
<ol>
<li>1986, Challenger Shuttle explosion, my class was watching it live, I was in grade school.</li>
<li>1999, Columbine HS shooting, I was watching TV at my boyfriend&rsquo;s apartment and we couldn&rsquo;t stop watching the coverage after he got home from work. I think this was the first major live-televised coverage of a mass shooting in the US.</li>
<li>2001, 9/11, my boyfriend had stayed at my house and we got woken up by a call from a friend asking if we&rsquo;d seen that a plane flew into the World Trade Center, we tuned in after the first plane and watched all day.</li>
<li>2021, 1/6, I just happened to sit down in front of the TV that morning, as on the west coast it was still early and I decided to see what was on MSNBC around 10am, that was exactly when all the concerned people and whispering started in the chamber and shortly after, well, you know what went down.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I am missing some, and maybe I&rsquo;ll update this post as they come to me. I guess I can just be glad I&rsquo;m not part of the generation that live-streams the horrific things they are doing to the world.</p>

<p>The prayer plant is putting up a bloom panicle, which you might be able to make out in this photo if you know what you&rsquo;re looking for. The hoya also in this room has already bloomed once this year and I think (knock on wood) I see signs of it blooming again!</p>

			 <p>Weird question: is there some timezone overlap I&rsquo;m missing to have not earned the Photo Challenge pin? I started my Featured Photo daily photo posts on July 21, which was obviously over seven days ago, and I&rsquo;ve posted daily for two weeks. The timezone overlap I&rsquo;m wondering about is if I&rsquo;ve posted in my timezone but somewhere it is still falling within a previous or subsequent day, and thereby not registering as the actual new/next day, or is the challenge in my timezone?</p>
<p>Anyway, I object to not having earned this yet! See <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/">Featured Photo category</a> for proof of more than 7-day streak posting a photo.</p>

			 <p>This morning&rsquo;s gardening video. I love a garden harvest video, especially when they are just overlayed with bird sound or ambient sound or non-obtrusive music. I subscribe to this channel but it is a mixed bag of &ldquo;styles&rdquo; meaning some videos are more freeform and others more structured. I think they license some for commercial use (products they use and review, perhaps). Veg harvest is towards the end of the video, roughly last third.</p>

			 <p>I got in the habit of posting the featured photo that my iPad Photos app puts on my home screen widget on one of my Mastodon accounts when I first started on there. I&rsquo;m actually considering rolling that account in favor of my micro.blog account with custom domain.</p>
<p>It was my first Mastodon account and I hadn&rsquo;t done much instance research other than to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; one of my favorite people from Twitter there. It&rsquo;s a big instance and what I&rsquo;ve found I like most about Mastodon and other Fediverse-type services is the &ldquo;local&rdquo; or &ldquo;community&rdquo; aspect. I&rsquo;ve even now found that bringing some of those people from other instances into that community can sometimes end up with them moving their account to another instance too. It&rsquo;s an interesting ecosystem. I like the flexibility. It&rsquo;s too bad you lose post history, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, before officially deciding on the account merge/switch/rollover, I&rsquo;ve decided to revive the featured photo tradition here, starting today.</p>

			 <p>I suppose I am still addicted or accustomed to the stream of consciousness chronological social media timeline, and less of a curated or refined timeline. As I&rsquo;m testing this out, I still seem to spend my day in Mastodon while working, and then pop in and out of micro.blog during &ldquo;lulls&rdquo; in the day. Or like tonight, while I&rsquo;m watching TV.</p>
<p>Weblog will probably continue to be where I put &ldquo;real thought&rdquo; into the content and share something I want around for the longer term or for reference over time. I still really want to make this be the launchpad for that stream of consciousness, but use filters + categories to ensure they get to the desired outlet rather than just spewing everywhere.</p>
<p>It might be a bit choppy for a while until I find a rhythm. And then I&rsquo;ll change it up again when I decide to get moving on the newsletter.</p>

<p>Low lighting this morning so not the best pic, but I had to get some watering done before it heats up this week.</p>

			 <p>I do keep having some phantom posts show up from feeds that I have since removed and deleted the entries for on micro.blog. I do not recommend this to anyone or myself in the future. Perhaps there is a batch process I&rsquo;m missing for deleting or adding categories to multiple posts at a time. That would be very useful.</p>
<p>I assume this is a cache issue and will resolve itself, but I&rsquo;m caught off-guard every time I refresh and some old since-deleted post re-emerges. If I manually trigger a rebuild they go away.</p>
<p>BTW, I can see that having both a Mastodon and Microblog category right next to each other is going to be an issue, since I keep messing up the one I apply.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;for discovery other than Discover or using one of the emoji filters? Something more chronological yet timely. It seems that Discover is a few days behind, or is it manually curated?</p>
<p>Local is actually one of the things I like most for discovering new people on an instance I just joined <em>or</em> for finding a new instance that I might want to be on. I know this isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;instance&rdquo; of Mastodon, but considering I&rsquo;m here already and know I want to be here, I was hoping for just general stream of conscience from micro.blog. Perhaps I need to get that from a feed somehow.</p>
<p>Any suggestions welcome!</p>
