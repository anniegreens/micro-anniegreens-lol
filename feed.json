				"title": "My ME Life: Lessons learned from Shingles",
				"content_html": "<p>Today&rsquo;s entry in this series‚Äîit has been a while‚Äîhas me remembering that time I had Shingles. The reason this comes up now is several-fold: many people are seeing themselves having Shingles right now following an initial or repeat Covid infection; I similarly had Shingles during some of my sickest years with ME/CFS prior to a remission; and it is an important lesson in mild or asymptomatic infection still leading to evidence of viral persistence and the long tail of chronic vs acute illness.</p>\n<p>I was in my early- to mid-20s, definitely not what is the expected age for Shingles. In fact, today you can&rsquo;t even get a Shingles vaccine until you are over 50 (unless approved by a doctor). Shingles is caused by the same virus as Chicken Pox. If you had Chicken Pox as a child you have this virus still residing in your body. This is what viruses do. Many common (and not so common) viruses take up residence in reservoirs and tissue and lie in wait to be reactivated later for any number of reasons, usually an additional stress or illness, and then can cause a whole new slew of terrible and more damaging illness than the acute stage of the virus. That is exactly what Long Covid is, by the way.</p>\n<p>Very often the acute state of a viral infection can be mild or asymptomatic. In my case, my sister, a few years older than me, had Chicken Pox. My parents, like many other parents in a wave of copy-cat like behavior, were led to believe the right thing to do was put us together &ldquo;to get it over with&rdquo; so we would both be sick at the same time. I never responded with a symptomatic infection. I never had a breakout of pox/bumps and the associated symptoms of Chicken Pox. Did I <em>have</em> Chicken Pox? Well, yes, because two decades later I had Shingles.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is that even with a mild or asymptomatic viral infection, you can still end up with a chronic condition from that virus. Likewise, you can have a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; or asymptomatic Covid infection and still end up chronically ill and disabled with Long Covid. Many asymptomatic infections are a result of your immune system being <em>unable</em> to mount a response, where your body may already be too sick or damaged to show signs of an infection. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t sick, it likely means more damage, unseen, is occurring within your body.</p>\n<p>My case of Shingles was considered out of the ordinary for someone who appeared to be well, yet with a chronic illness, ME/CFS. Up until the last ten years or so, ME/CFS was still widely ignored and refuted by medical professionals. Some of this still persists today and is being taken up again in the fight to recognize Long Covid. It took me around five years to get any sort of answer about my condition and be told I have ME/CFS. Even afterwards I was psychologized, told to push through it, that the will to get &ldquo;better&rdquo; was in my head and my own fault. With Shingles too I was first told it was a rash, even when I explained the terrible pain I was in.</p>\n<p>Shingles, if untreated, can damage nerves, internal organs, and cause blindness if on the face. This is why it can appear to &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; your body. For me it was on the side of my torso and wrapped around the front to my belly. To this day, I still have lingering pain sometimes and wonder if there is internal damage due to the length of time it took for my doctor to recognize what it was and agree to treat me. Treatment is an anti-viral. If that sounds familiar, that may be because acute treatment of Covid is also an anti-viral. They work to stop viral replication from occurring inside the body. Years ago, and perhaps still today, when I had Shingles, many anti-virals were used to treat common sexually transmitted viruses.</p>\n<p>While I had insurance through a state-run program, the list of approved medicine did <em>not</em> cover these anti-virals specifically because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted viruses. It was like the boards, likely mostly men, sitting around deciding what medication they deemed &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; for people to take should include methods to shame people when they acquired illnesses of &ldquo;ill repute.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I was a young chronically ill person who had already been mistreated and gaslighted so much by the medical profession and now I faced paying $600 out of pocket for an anti-viral to protect my nerves and organs from damage. Is it any wonder I don&rsquo;t trust doctors and healthcare even to this day? They haven&rsquo;t gotten any better looking at how the pandemic is being handled. Depending on the calculator you use, $600 then is over $1100 today, and medication is far more expensive now.

				"content_text": "Today's entry in this series‚Äîit has been a while‚Äîhas me remembering that time I had Shingles. The reason this comes up now is several-fold: many people are seeing themselves having Shingles right now following an initial or repeat Covid infection; I similarly had Shingles during some of my sickest years with ME/CFS prior to a remission; and it is an important lesson in mild or asymptomatic infection still leading to evidence of viral persistence and the long tail of chronic vs acute illness.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI was in my early- to mid-20s, definitely not what is the expected age for Shingles. In fact, today you can't even get a Shingles vaccine until you are over 50 (unless approved by a doctor). Shingles is caused by the same virus as Chicken Pox. If you had Chicken Pox as a child you have this virus still residing in your body. This is what viruses do. Many common (and not so common) viruses take up residence in reservoirs and tissue and lie in wait to be reactivated later for any number of reasons, usually an additional stress or illness, and then can cause a whole new slew of terrible and more damaging illness than the acute stage of the virus. That is exactly what Long Covid is, by the way.\n\nVery often the acute state of a viral infection can be mild or asymptomatic. In my case, my sister, a few years older than me, had Chicken Pox. My parents, like many other parents in a wave of copy-cat like behavior, were led to believe the right thing to do was put us together \"to get it over with\" so we would both be sick at the same time. I never responded with a symptomatic infection. I never had a breakout of pox/bumps and the associated symptoms of Chicken Pox. Did I *have* Chicken Pox? Well, yes, because two decades later I had Shingles.\n\nThe lesson here is that even with a mild or asymptomatic viral infection, you can still end up with a chronic condition from that virus. Likewise, you can have a \"mild\" or asymptomatic Covid infection and still end up chronically ill and disabled with Long Covid. Many asymptomatic infections are a result of your immune system being *unable* to mount a response, where your body may already be too sick or damaged to show signs of an infection. That doesn't mean you aren't sick, it likely means more damage, unseen, is occurring within your body.\n\nMy case of Shingles was considered out of the ordinary for someone who appeared to be well, yet with a chronic illness, ME/CFS. Up until the last ten years or so, ME/CFS was still widely ignored and refuted by medical professionals. Some of this still persists today and is being taken up again in the fight to recognize Long Covid. It took me around five years to get any sort of answer about my condition and be told I have ME/CFS. Even afterwards I was psychologized, told to push through it, that the will to get \"better\" was in my head and my own fault. With Shingles too I was first told it was a rash, even when I explained the terrible pain I was in.\n\nShingles, if untreated, can damage nerves, internal organs, and cause blindness if on the face. This is why it can appear to \"wrap around\" your body. For me it was on the side of my torso and wrapped around the front to my belly. To this day, I still have lingering pain sometimes and wonder if there is internal damage due to the length of time it took for my doctor to recognize what it was and agree to treat me. Treatment is an anti-viral. If that sounds familiar, that may be because acute treatment of Covid is also an anti-viral. They work to stop viral replication from occurring inside the body. Years ago, and perhaps still today, when I had Shingles, many anti-virals were used to treat common sexually transmitted viruses.\n\nWhile I had insurance through a state-run program, the list of approved medicine did *not* cover these anti-virals specifically because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted viruses. It was like the boards, likely mostly men, sitting around deciding what medication they deemed \"appropriate\" for people to take should include methods to shame people when they acquired illnesses of \"ill repute.\"\n\nI was a young chronically ill person who had already been mistreated and gaslighted so much by the medical profession and now I faced paying $600 out of pocket for an anti-viral to protect my nerves and organs from damage. Is it any wonder I don't trust doctors and healthcare even to this day? They haven't gotten any better looking at how the pandemic is being handled. Depending on the calculator you use, $600 then is over $1100 today, and medication is far more expensive now. I have been seeing people with insurance coverage paying $900 out of pocket for Paxlovid.\n\nMy ME/CFS was also caused by a viral infection, likely Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV), the virus that causes Mononucleosis in the acute stage. Many people with Long Covid go on to qualify for the diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS. These post-viral illnesses all act similarly: an acute viral illness followed by some period of time and then another health trigger, either stress or another illness, often viral, that reactivates a virus-in-waiting in the body months or years later, launching the chronic illness stage.\n\nI've been watching this happen on repeat for so many years now I have started to see patterns. Following my anti-viral treatment for Shingles I entered a remission in my ME/CFS. No one at the time made any connection, and frankly neither did I. But now I have been reading studies and literature about Long Covid and additional related post-viral illness, and anti-virals can play a key role in these conditions.\n",

But I know I got a lot done and I blogged about it so let&rsquo;s take a look at what I posted across my many blogs. Normally I organize these links chronologically regardless of blog. This time, since I&rsquo;m now posting regularly on so many, I&rsquo;m going to break it up into blog sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apple-annies-weblog\">Apple Annie&rsquo;s Weblog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I wrote a <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/weblogpomo-2024-retrospective-communities-of-content\">WeblogPoMo 2024 Retrospective: Communities of Content</a>.</li>\n<li>I completed a very long interview. Long due my answers to the questions being long. The interview has not published yet, but when it does I&rsquo;ll be posting my own version on weblog.</li>\n<li>I finally published a very long list of modern CSS that I&rsquo;m working on learning and brushing up my skills with: <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/this-is-not-your-fathers-css\">This is not your father&rsquo;s CSS.</a></li>\n<li>I signed up for a Letterbird Pro contact form and added it to both weblog and microblog and wrote about customizing it: <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/a-contact-page-with-a-customized-letterbird-form\">A Contact page with a customized Letterbird form.</a></li>\n<li>I took the Blogroll for another spin: <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/blogroll-spin-7\">Blogroll Spin #7</a></li>\n<li>I am currently working on a weblog homepage revamp that includes reworking my global navigation. Looking forward to blogging about it when I&rsquo;m done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"apple-annies-microblog\">Apple Annie&rsquo;s Microblog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/\">Featured photos</a> continue and I&rsquo;ve switched my methods up again. Now I randomly go into my photo library via the Photos.app and delve into a year and month based on what the Photos app has placed as the &ldquo;photo&rdquo; for that month. It&rsquo;s working out well so far, and helps me see what was blooming or going on at the same time during that year.</li>\n<li>My Garden Status posts were coming along until the heatwave hit:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/01/garden-status.html\">üå± Garden Status (2024/06/01)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/15/garden-status.html\">üå± Garden Status (2024/06/15)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/01/garden-status.html\">üå± Garden Status (2024/07/01)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I wrote several posts about Micro.blog and how I feel on this platform and my future here:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/02/a-community-of.html\">A community of complaints.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/10/im-frustrated-here.html\">I&rsquo;m frustrated here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was quite a kerfuffle, which is putting it mildly, between several people working on Micro.blog and Adam of omg.lol over some behavior. I will not hash it out here again, but this entire situation has also left me feeling out of place on this platform since no accountability or recourse has happened for that behavior. In fact the entire situation was turned around on Adam, who did nothing but stand up for the marginalized person that was being attacked.</li>\n<li>I watched the entire US King Kong franchise for the first time and posted quotes.</li>\n<li>I watched some new (to me) TV shows and posted some quotes.</li>\n<li>I posted quotes from people&rsquo;s blogs, social media posts, other articles on several subjects, including AI, tech, the web, chronic illness, health and sickness, and climate change and severe weather events.</li>\n<li>You should probably just check out my <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/quote/\">Quote</a> category because there are too many to list here.</li>\n<li>I posted other pictures from my garden:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/06/two-salvias-in.html\">üå± Two salvias in opposing corners of the backyard.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/07/side-yard-comparison.html\">Side yard comparison, year-to-year.</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I had several tough weeks.</li>\n<li>I posted about starting a new challenge and finding a theme issue: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html\">I started 100 Days to Offload challenge today.</a></li>\n<li>I found meaning in a blog post to help me think through the previously mentioned kerfuffle: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/13/on-accountability.html\">On Accountability</a></li>\n<li>I watched season three of Bridgerton and crushed on Colin.</li>\n<li>I posted more about AI: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/18/i-dont-want.html\">I don&rsquo;t want attribution.</a></li>\n<li>I found something I felt to be out of place on a Micro.blog theme and wrote about it: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/19/i-hope-i.html\">I hope I word this okay.</a></li>\n<li>I ordered and received some plants from Annie&rsquo;s Annuals and Perennials. I&rsquo;ve yet to get them in the ground due to the heatwave. Crossing my fingers to get it done this weekend.</li>\n<li>I was grossed out by some content on a Youtube channel I&rsquo;ve subscribed to for quite a while and I&rsquo;ve stopped subscribing. When people show you who they are, believe them.</li>\n<li>The debate was a turning point, nothing has gone well since, and I&rsquo;m glad I did not watch it: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/26/i-am-not.html\">I am not interested in anything that comes from tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.</a></li>\n<li>I had an issue with posting to one blog in one tab and opening another tab and navigating to configuration for another: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/28/i-think-we.html\">I think we need a way to move a post from one blog to another.</a></li>\n<li>I sold one of my cars right before the heatwave hit and it was far more demoralizing that I expected and set me off poorly into what turned into a bad week during the heatwave.</li>\n<li>I started reading a new book: <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/06/currently-reading-the.html\">Currently reading: The Viral Underclass by Steven W. Thrasher üìö</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"100-days-of-blog\">100 Days of Blog</h3>\n<p>I started the <a href=\"https://100daystooffload.com/\">100 Days to Offload</a> challenge and set up this blog to do the posting exclusively for the challenge.

				"content_text": "It has been a ridiculously long time since my [last note](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/31/some-day-notes.html) and much has happened. Last time we were just wrapping up WeblogPoMo and I was planning on taking a relaxed June, but decided at the last minute to take part in [Junited 2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/junited-2024) and then I launched into posting on [100 Days of Blog](https://100daysof.blog) for the [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOn top of many life events and incidents, stuff has not been very relaxing. But I know I got a lot done and I blogged about it so let's take a look at what I posted across my many blogs. Normally I organize these links chronologically regardless of blog. This time, since I'm now posting regularly on so many, I'm going to break it up into blog sections.\n\n### Apple Annie's Weblog\n\n- I wrote a [WeblogPoMo 2024 Retrospective: Communities of Content](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/weblogpomo-2024-retrospective-communities-of-content).\n- I completed a very long interview. Long due my answers to the questions being long. The interview has not published yet, but when it does I'll be posting my own version on weblog.\n- I finally published a very long list of modern CSS that I'm working on learning and brushing up my skills with: [This is not your father's CSS.](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/this-is-not-your-fathers-css)\n- I signed up for a Letterbird Pro contact form and added it to both weblog and microblog and wrote about customizing it: [A Contact page with a customized Letterbird form.](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/a-contact-page-with-a-customized-letterbird-form)\n- I took the Blogroll for another spin: [Blogroll Spin #7](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/blogroll-spin-7)\n- I am currently working on a weblog homepage revamp that includes reworking my global navigation. Looking forward to blogging about it when I'm done.\n\n### Apple Annie's Microblog\n\n- [Featured photos](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/featured-photo/) continue and I've switched my methods up again. Now I randomly go into my photo library via the Photos.app and delve into a year and month based on what the Photos app has placed as the \"photo\" for that month. It's working out well so far, and helps me see what was blooming or going on at the same time during that year.\n- My Garden Status posts were coming along until the heatwave hit:\n  - [üå± Garden Status (2024/06/01)](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/01/garden-status.html)\n  - [üå± Garden Status (2024/06/15)](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/15/garden-status.html)\n  - [üå± Garden Status (2024/07/01)](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/01/garden-status.html)\n- I wrote several posts about Micro.blog and how I feel on this platform and my future here:\n  - [A community of complaints.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/02/a-community-of.html)\n  - [I'm frustrated here.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/10/im-frustrated-here.html)\n- There was quite a kerfuffle, which is putting it mildly, between several people working on Micro.blog and Adam of omg.lol over some behavior. I will not hash it out here again, but this entire situation has also left me feeling out of place on this platform since no accountability or recourse has happened for that behavior. In fact the entire situation was turned around on Adam, who did nothing but stand up for the marginalized person that was being attacked.\n- I watched the entire US King Kong franchise for the first time and posted quotes.\n- I watched some new (to me) TV shows and posted some quotes.\n- I posted quotes from people's blogs, social media posts, other articles on several subjects, including AI, tech, the web, chronic illness, health and sickness, and climate change and severe weather events.\n- You should probably just check out my [Quote](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/quote/) category because there are too many to list here.\n- I posted other pictures from my garden:\n  - [üå± Two salvias in opposing corners of the backyard.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/06/two-salvias-in.html)\n  - [Side yard comparison, year-to-year.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/07/side-yard-comparison.html)\n- I had several tough weeks.\n- I posted about starting a new challenge and finding a theme issue: [I started 100 Days to Offload challenge today.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html)\n- I found meaning in a blog post to help me think through the previously mentioned kerfuffle: [On Accountability](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/13/on-accountability.html)\n- I watched season three of Bridgerton and crushed on Colin.\n- I posted more about AI: [I don't want attribution.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/18/i-dont-want.html)\n- I found something I felt to be out of place on a Micro.blog theme and wrote about it: [I hope I word this okay.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/19/i-hope-i.html)\n- I ordered and received some plants from Annie's Annuals and Perennials. I've yet to get them in the ground due to the heatwave. Crossing my fingers to get it done this weekend.\n- I was grossed out by some content on a Youtube channel I've subscribed to for quite a while and I've stopped subscribing. When people show you who they are, believe them.\n- The debate was a turning point, nothing has gone well since, and I'm glad I did not watch it: [I am not interested in anything that comes from tomorrow's debate.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/26/i-am-not.html)\n- I had an issue with posting to one blog in one tab and opening another tab and navigating to configuration for another: [I think we need a way to move a post from one blog to another.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/28/i-think-we.html)\n- I sold one of my cars right before the heatwave hit and it was far more demoralizing that I expected and set me off poorly into what turned into a bad week during the heatwave.\n- I started reading a new book: [Currently reading: The Viral Underclass by Steven W. Thrasher üìö](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/06/currently-reading-the.html)\n\n### 100 Days of Blog\n\nI started the [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge and set up this blog to do the posting exclusively for the challenge. I used a contributed Micro.blog theme and did some minor customizations, mostly digging into Hugo template overrides and getting the posts to only show a summary on the paginated listing pages. I have posted [twenty-six posts on this blog](https://100daysof.blog) for the challenge so far. I've really enjoyed the format I chose, which is to sum up the previous day or days in a sort of \"day in the life.\" I'm taking Sundays off, and occasionally other days as necessary. The cadence has not been too much so far.\n\n### 3x5.pics\n\nI am continuing posting a note every four days to 3x5.pics and I'm still really loving this little site. I submitted it for a [Tiny Award](https://tinyawards.net/) because I'm really just so in love with it. I have no idea if it is the type of thing that this award goes for, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Finalists will be announced July 19 and public voting will also open at that time.\n\n### Weblog Themes/Custom/Styles\n\nI didn't make much progress on these sites during the last six weeks. In fact, the homepage of [themes.lol](https://themes.lol) still shows my May 2024 status post, I need to get that updated within the next week, as I *have* made some progress working on [Custom](https://custom.themes.lol) over just the last few days.\n\n- I created a [Definitions](https://custom.themes.lol/definitions) page for listing out all weblog templates and configuration settings.\n- I wrote [a post on customizing a weblog homepage](https://custom.themes.lol/2024/07/customizing-a-weblog-homepage) and customized the Custom homepage at the same time.\n- I started a page on Shortcodes (aka \"tags\") for weblog that I hope to have completed soon.\n\nThat's all for now, I think it has been enough üòÖ Have a great week!\n",

We had some rain today and the centers gathered the rainfall and a fly was taking a drink, I could not decide on a favorite so you get all three.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878164_fcf42968f5_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878164_fcf42968f5_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878164_c6db9f8947_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878164_9d556c793c_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878164_fcf42968f5_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A butter yellow double Shasta daisy coming into full bloom with fluffy heads atop glossy green foliage next to green grass and some river rock.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A butter yellow double Shasta daisy coming into full bloom with fluffy heads atop glossy green foliage next to green grass and some river rock. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXzFQ1\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53792625882_589367c681_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53792625882_589367c681_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53792625882_fbdf5d2b81_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53792625882_1290317b4c_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53792625882_589367c681_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXtgyW\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878209_24e0f04e96_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878209_24e0f04e96_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878209_27056867d1_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878209_cdf8c26448_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878209_24e0f04e96_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Close up of several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Close up of several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXzFQM\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793787178_f6b944bb66_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793787178_f6b944bb66_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793787178_3e0f75a672_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793787178_387b05feba_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793787178_f6b944bb66_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Another close up of several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Another close up of several full blooms on a butter yellow double Shasta daisy with a common green bottle fly on one of the blooms taking a drink of rainwater that has gathered in the center of the bloom. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXzdMh\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAlong the top of the rockery, and to be honest *through* the rockery, the blue star creeper is...creeping. This plant is a thug and I have to tear bunches of it out every year but I just cannot tear it out completely. Not only because it would be so hard but because *look at it*, it creates this mounding cascade of blue pillows this time of year and is usually covered in bees.

				"title": "üîÜ Little bright spot",
				"content_html": "<p>Today&rsquo;s little bright spot is complicated.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning, before I&rsquo;d even made coffee or gotten out of my robe, I heard cracking. The sound of wood doing something it shouldn&rsquo;t. At first I looked outside in the direction I thought it was coming from and didn&rsquo;t see anything unusual. Or so I thought. We had a bunch of rain the day before and my neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree, freshly laden with leaves, did appear to be hanging a bit low in front of the garage, but not <em>too</em> low.</p>\n<p>But the cracking continued. And the tree was falling. All day. Lower and lower. I went outside to try to assess what was going to happen with it, since the direct path of the fall was my garage. I had a pile of mulch in front of the garage, leftover from moving it around my yard, but directly in the way of getting the car out of the garage.</p>\n<p>So, there in my robe, having had no coffee, I shoved half the mulch pile into the wheelbarrow and over to the side of the driveway, enough so that I could get the car out of the garage, a) before something terrible happened, or b) the tree branches blocked me from doing so. I managed to do both things still in my robe.</p>\n<p>After that I concentrated on calling people: my neighbor, who I had not heard from and who I don&rsquo;t think was home, my homeowners insurance, unsure if I&rsquo;d need to make a claim, and several other neighbors to talk about the circumstances. The circumstances as they were that that tree should have come out ten years ago. I&rsquo;ve hated it since I bought this house. And apparently the neighbor knew it needed to come out and had had the tree service over <em>a week ago</em> to start the removal process.</p>\n<p>In Portland if you want to do anything with a tree, you need a permit. Unless you are planting one on private property. But if you are removing one, you need a permit. If you are planting one in a right-of-way like the parking strip, you need a permit. It&rsquo;s a system that has lofty goals but rarely works to achieve those goals and most people hate the system. First of all, it is slow. Painfully slow.</p>\n<p>So while the neighbor was waiting on a permit the tree went ahead and fell on my garage. Now, I don&rsquo;t know that they knew it was in danger of falling, but I do know that three days ago I was clearing the gutter on that side of the garage in preparation for the rain on Thursday, and I kept hitting my head on a branch <em>that didn&rsquo;t used to be there</em> so I suspect my neighbor knew something was happening and that the tree was already leaning. I did not recall this hitting-of-my-head until this morning when I was talking with the arborist.</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about this tree. It is an apricot tree, and a very large old apricot tree, most likely planted back when this neighborhood used be full of empty lots and many vegetable gardens and fruit trees. My yard likely had a fruit tree too. And that house was built in the 50s the same time my garage was built, so it is likely that that apricot tree was in an empty lot. My house was built almost 100 years ago.</p>\n<p>Apricot trees, like many stone fruit trees, like warm dry weather, they are not suited to Portland&rsquo;s climate for the most part. And that tree was never happy. Every spring it would barely bloom as we&rsquo;d get a late cold snap, and then it would try to leaf out only to be hit with a long wet spring and sporadically drop leaves, sprout more leaves, and drop leaves again. It would try to fruit, but it never succeeded, instead it dropped sappy orange goo onto my garage roof which would then dry and stick to the shingle&rsquo;s texture and rip it off. Then to top it all off, every fall it would drop all its leaves nearly at once, covering the entire east side of my garage roof, gutter, and the narrow space between the garage and neighbor&rsquo;s fence. So many leaves, so stinky, that it could fill my green compost bin three or four times.</p>\n<p>I hate(d) that tree.</p>\n<p>The neighbor was going to remove that tree. They had started the process of doing that and were planning on footing the bill. But as soon as the tree fell and endangered my property, I became responsible for part of it. This is bullshit. I looked high and low for the reasoning that I could tell them they needed to pay for the entire removal without luck. It is viewed as &ldquo;storm damage&rdquo; and if it hadn&rsquo;t damaged my garage would not even be covered by my insurance. Even with my insurance coverage I&rsquo;d still have to pay my $1000 deductible. I didn&rsquo;t know if the cost of all the removal + damage would even exceed that.</p>\n<p>Friday proved fruitless (heh üòè) in getting an arborist to come out, but my neighbor was able to get the arborist that was going to remove the tree and that was waiting on the city for a permit to come out today, Saturday. In the meantime the tree dug in, so to speak, piercing my garage roof, denting my gutter, and falling lower and lower in front of the garage door. I was under the impression that my garage was holding the entire weight of that tree for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The arborist was very kind. He was actually the owner of a very popular tree service in Portland and did all the removal of the portion on my side himself, from the top of the roof. Another crew member hauled the branches away down my driveway. I ended up paying for the hourly service of two crew members, quoted $600-700 though I have yet to be invoiced.

				"content_text": "Today's little bright spot is complicated.\n\nYesterday morning, before I'd even made coffee or gotten out of my robe, I heard cracking. The sound of wood doing something it shouldn't. At first I looked outside in the direction I thought it was coming from and didn't see anything unusual. Or so I thought. We had a bunch of rain the day before and my neighbor's apricot tree, freshly laden with leaves, did appear to be hanging a bit low in front of the garage, but not *too* low.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBut the cracking continued. And the tree was falling. All day. Lower and lower. I went outside to try to assess what was going to happen with it, since the direct path of the fall was my garage. I had a pile of mulch in front of the garage, leftover from moving it around my yard, but directly in the way of getting the car out of the garage.\n\nSo, there in my robe, having had no coffee, I shoved half the mulch pile into the wheelbarrow and over to the side of the driveway, enough so that I could get the car out of the garage, a) before something terrible happened, or b) the tree branches blocked me from doing so. I managed to do both things still in my robe.\n\nAfter that I concentrated on calling people: my neighbor, who I had not heard from and who I don't think was home, my homeowners insurance, unsure if I'd need to make a claim, and several other neighbors to talk about the circumstances. The circumstances as they were that that tree should have come out ten years ago. I've hated it since I bought this house. And apparently the neighbor knew it needed to come out and had had the tree service over *a week ago* to start the removal process.\n\nIn Portland if you want to do anything with a tree, you need a permit. Unless you are planting one on private property. But if you are removing one, you need a permit. If you are planting one in a right-of-way like the parking strip, you need a permit. It's a system that has lofty goals but rarely works to achieve those goals and most people hate the system. First of all, it is slow. Painfully slow.\n\nSo while the neighbor was waiting on a permit the tree went ahead and fell on my garage. Now, I don't know that they knew it was in danger of falling, but I do know that three days ago I was clearing the gutter on that side of the garage in preparation for the rain on Thursday, and I kept hitting my head on a branch *that didn't used to be there* so I suspect my neighbor knew something was happening and that the tree was already leaning. I did not recall this hitting-of-my-head until this morning when I was talking with the arborist.\n\nBut let's talk a little bit more about this tree. It is an apricot tree, and a very large old apricot tree, most likely planted back when this neighborhood used be full of empty lots and many vegetable gardens and fruit trees. My yard likely had a fruit tree too. And that house was built in the 50s the same time my garage was built, so it is likely that that apricot tree was in an empty lot. My house was built almost 100 years ago.\n\nApricot trees, like many stone fruit trees, like warm dry weather, they are not suited to Portland's climate for the most part. And that tree was never happy. Every spring it would barely bloom as we'd get a late cold snap, and then it would try to leaf out only to be hit with a long wet spring and sporadically drop leaves, sprout more leaves, and drop leaves again. It would try to fruit, but it never succeeded, instead it dropped sappy orange goo onto my garage roof which would then dry and stick to the shingle's texture and rip it off. Then to top it all off, every fall it would drop all its leaves nearly at once, covering the entire east side of my garage roof, gutter, and the narrow space between the garage and neighbor's fence. So many leaves, so stinky, that it could fill my green compost bin three or four times.\n\nI hate(d) that tree.\n\nThe neighbor was going to remove that tree. They had started the process of doing that and were planning on footing the bill. But as soon as the tree fell and endangered my property, I became responsible for part of it. This is bullshit. I looked high and low for the reasoning that I could tell them they needed to pay for the entire removal without luck. It is viewed as \"storm damage\" and if it hadn't damaged my garage would not even be covered by my insurance. Even with my insurance coverage I'd still have to pay my $1000 deductible. I didn't know if the cost of all the removal + damage would even exceed that.\n\nFriday proved fruitless (heh üòè) in getting an arborist to come out, but my neighbor was able to get the arborist that was going to remove the tree and that was waiting on the city for a permit to come out today, Saturday. In the meantime the tree dug in, so to speak, piercing my garage roof, denting my gutter, and falling lower and lower in front of the garage door. I was under the impression that my garage was holding the entire weight of that tree for 24 hours.\n\nThe arborist was very kind. He was actually the owner of a very popular tree service in Portland and did all the removal of the portion on my side himself, from the top of the roof. Another crew member hauled the branches away down my driveway. I ended up paying for the hourly service of two crew members, quoted $600-700 though I have yet to be invoiced. I imagine the bulk of the tree and trunk removal to be quite a bit more than that on my neighbors side, but again, it is their tree and they were planning on removing it anyway. I am bit perturbed by this fact and that they didn't offer to cover the entire cost. It is frankly a bitch move and not very neighborly.\n\nWe ended up being very lucky. The damage to the garage is minimal in the end: two roof shingles and a dented gutter; my neighbor's fence has some snapped off slats but it was in need of repair anyway. Two things were working in our favor: on my neighbor's side a 2x4 piece of lumber in part of their kid's play set was holding up part of the tree's weight; on my side, a 4x4 concrete-filled steel post used by a gate (overkill much?) was holding up another part of the tree's weight. It could have been far worse. But I'm still under the deductible so I'm footing all of this work and damage.\n\nSo, you are asking, how is this a little bright spot, Anne? I'm doing a lot of complaining.\n\nWell, what if I told you someone came to me months ago and said: for roughly $600 we will remove that tree that you hate so much? You will never have to clean its mess up again *and* an abundance of light would flood into your backyard making you able to possibly grow vegetables again! Yes! I would absolutely do that! I would pay $600 to never deal with that tree again!\n",

I've also been busy with more [web projects](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/projects) and tinkering and am about to jump into another one in May, though a couple of them are just sitting on the back burner for now while I am occupied by other things.\n\nSo let's get into it!\n\n- On the same day I posted my last note, I published [*What I've learned about CSS `color-scheme` and friends.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/what-ive-learned-about-css-color-scheme-and-system-color) and was surprised and delighted by the positive reactions to it. Nothing is a better cure for imposter syndrome than writing something slightly technical and getting good feedback from a mostly technical audience. I really love this \"format\" of writing: diving into a topic, making a tangible example/use case, and blogging about it‚ÄîI would do nothing but this if I could!\n- I am continuing the April photo blogging [challenge](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/challenge/) on Micro.blog and doing better this time with not beating myself up over diving into my photo library for many of the pictures. I've taken some new ones, but 80% of the entries are probably from the archive.\n- I'm trying to be better about writing more openly about the different parts of me. [*Owning your content is owning yourself.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/owning-your-content-is-owning-yourself)\n- On the heals of buying `tableforone.cafe` I wrote about one of the ideas I have for it: [*My grandmother's recipe box.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/my-grandmothers-recipe-box)\n- A [*Garden Status (2024/04/11)*](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/11/garden-status-it.html) post, which is a series I'm trying to keep up on, if not intermittently. This is the time of year for it, though it might be nice to continue with it year round because the garden never truly sleeps.\n- [*Blogroll Spin #4*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/blogroll-spin-4) is in the books and with it more omg.lol members join the list üòÖ\n- My long-awaited [*Weblog Publishing Workflow*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblog-publishing-workflow) is finally finished and published. This took so long to do and caused me a lot of anguish, partly because I didn't want to miss anything and partly because it is a bit of exposure into how I'm doing things unconventionally and I didn't want to be judged. But we can't get through life without being judged so I pulled off the bandage and bared my wounds! Really, it turned out pretty great, and I've gotten lovely feedback on it as well. Thanks to all those who have told me they liked it! I think my takeaway from the experience and feedback is that there truly is no right way to get your content onto the web and that is really part of the beauty of it üíú\n- 100th weblog post! Fittingly, the *Weblog Publishing Workflow* post was my 100th weblog post. Thinking about getting all these posts into the last ~15 months has made me eye a goal: completing the [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) blogging challenge some time in the next year! And that had me acquiring *another* new domain: `100daysof.blog` which will also be a Micro.blog blog. Both this and `tableforone.cafe` are sitting idle because I have too many things going on at once right now (why do we do this to ourselves?)\n- I read and listened to many chronic illness and health-related things:\n  - [This could be a big deal for people like me...](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/12/this-could-be.html)\n  - [It is impossible to read this and square it with...](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/it-is-impossible.html)\n  - [Put a hold on this book on Libby...](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/21/put-a-hold.html)\n- I've been using a web component on my weblog (and [wrote about it](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component) in February) for embedding a Mastodon post, retrieving interactions for the post, and prompting more interaction. The author of that component recently created another that I'm now using on my microblog, in combination with EchoFeed, and I'm really liking how it is working out. [*Adding link previews to echoes on my microblog.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/adding-link-previews-to-echoes-on-my-microblog)\n- Of course I had some AI-related opinions:\n  - [The \"publicly on the web\" excuse for AI is malarkey.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/16/the-publicly-on.html)\n  - [Your AI isn't making my life better.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/17/your-ai-isnt.html)\n  - [It's just the same boring playbook...](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/19/its-just-the.html)\n  - [This period is the great dumbing down.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/19/this-period-is.html)\n- On the tails of my `color-scheme` post, and in pursuit of extending this knowledge and usefulness, I pursued an idea I had been toying with and which I saw some discussion of on Mastodon. I'm starting with themes.lol using `color-mix()` with the `accent-color` used on some form controls with system colors to get a \"hue\" in both light and dark modes. I'm still working on this, and want to implement it elsewhere, but will definitely have a post on it at some point, likely during the upcoming blogging challenge.\n- I wrote some more about my garden: [*I have a yard. No, I have a garden.*](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/i-have-a.html)\n- And more: [*The gentians are in their prime.*](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/the-gentians-are.html)\n- And even more: [*Here is the result of my hard work this week.*](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/18/here-is-the.html)\n- We all need a [üîÜ Little bright spot](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/20/little-bright-spot.html).\n- Finally, the *biggest news of this note*: [WeblogPoMo 2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024)! This will occupy my time and concentration for the month of May so that is why many other projects may sit idle or see very little progress for at least another month. But I do foresee some of the things I'll be blogging about making their way into already active projects, such as themes.lol and even weblog proper.\n- I expand a bit on this new blogging challenge in a post: [*WeblogPoMo 2024 and tiny pages.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblogpomo-2024-and-tiny-pages)\n- I purchased yet another omg.lol address, üçè, and with it I plan to set up my \"tiny pages\" to use for CSS experiments during WeblogPoMo.\n- JS Naked Day (today) made me have thoughts: [Excuse me while I beleaguer a point.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/23/excuse-me-while.html)\n\nThat is probably all for now. As WeblogPoMo will absorb all my brain resources for the next month, I may not have a new note until it ends. Have a great week and see you in June!\n",

				"title": "I have a yard. No, I have a garden.",
				"content_html": "<p>You might notice I talk or post about it a bit. I share photos. I am proud of my garden. Every single plant in it I put there. What used to be empty terraces in the front and lawn all around, is now a mature and varied garden with interesting microclimates and &ldquo;rooms&rdquo;. This took thought, patience, and dedication.</p>\n<p>Gardens need places for the eye to rest. Moments of silence in the physical landscape. Sometimes this takes shape with a lawn. People hate lawns because they use water and chemicals. But lawns still provide a purpose and if used in moderation I still feel have their place in the garden.</p>\n<p>In my garden there are only two small areas of lawn remaining. I removed all of the rest of the lawn, approximately 2/3rds of the total lawn that used to make up my yard is now landscaped garden beds designed by me. But that remaining lawn does require irrigation. Had there not already been lawn and irrigation here when I bought this house, it is likely there never would have been.</p>\n<p>In the city of Portland you are required to maintain an irrigation system. This might or might not mean you hire someone to do that. But at a minimum someone licensed to do so must perform a backflow test, and this usually coincides with the spring startup of the system. For me this occurred on Tuesday this week, and I had the guy perform a couple tweaks to my system.</p>\n<p>One of those tweaks was to the controller. Six or so years ago I had a weather system put in that is connected to my irrigation controller. It is just a little device that collects rain water and tips it out when it gets to a certain point, takes temperature readings, etc. and stores all of that data in the controller and tells it when the different zones of my garden need water.</p>\n<p>I have four zones, only two of them are lawn, the two areas mentioned above. The remaining two are drip for some of the newer areas of garden beds where I provide drip emitters directly to a plant&rsquo;s roots. Now you may be wondering why I am telling this backstory about my yard, garden, irrigation, lawn, etc. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>\n<p>My neighborhood has a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; raccoon population. I&rsquo;ve witnessed entire families traveling through my yard. I&rsquo;ve seen momma&rsquo;s with five kits scaling a fence. I&rsquo;ve see a momma with a single kit in the middle of the day! But mostly I see the aftermath of raccoons in my yard. And of that aftermath is what happens during the summer when it is hot and the irrigation runs late at night/in the middle of the night and the raccoons decide to have a party.</p>\n<p>It is not a pretty sight. It is a mess. They damage plants, they dig holes, they cause mayhem.

				"content_text": "You might notice I talk or post about it a bit. I share photos. I am proud of my garden. Every single plant in it I put there. What used to be empty terraces in the front and lawn all around, is now a mature and varied garden with interesting microclimates and \"rooms\". This took thought, patience, and dedication.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nGardens need places for the eye to rest. Moments of silence in the physical landscape. Sometimes this takes shape with a lawn. People hate lawns because they use water and chemicals. But lawns still provide a purpose and if used in moderation I still feel have their place in the garden.\r\n\r\nIn my garden there are only two small areas of lawn remaining. I removed all of the rest of the lawn, approximately 2/3rds of the total lawn that used to make up my yard is now landscaped garden beds designed by me. But that remaining lawn does require irrigation. Had there not already been lawn and irrigation here when I bought this house, it is likely there never would have been.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Portland you are required to maintain an irrigation system. This might or might not mean you hire someone to do that. But at a minimum someone licensed to do so must perform a backflow test, and this usually coincides with the spring startup of the system. For me this occurred on Tuesday this week, and I had the guy perform a couple tweaks to my system.\r\n\r\nOne of those tweaks was to the controller. Six or so years ago I had a weather system put in that is connected to my irrigation controller. It is just a little device that collects rain water and tips it out when it gets to a certain point, takes temperature readings, etc. and stores all of that data in the controller and tells it when the different zones of my garden need water.\r\n\r\nI have four zones, only two of them are lawn, the two areas mentioned above. The remaining two are drip for some of the newer areas of garden beds where I provide drip emitters directly to a plant's roots. Now you may be wondering why I am telling this backstory about my yard, garden, irrigation, lawn, etc. Here's why.\r\n\r\nMy neighborhood has a \"healthy\" raccoon population. I've witnessed entire families traveling through my yard. I've seen momma's with five kits scaling a fence. I've see a momma with a single kit in the middle of the day! But mostly I see the aftermath of raccoons in my yard. And of that aftermath is what happens during the summer when it is hot and the irrigation runs late at night/in the middle of the night and the raccoons decide to have a party.\r\n\r\nIt is not a pretty sight. It is a mess. They damage plants, they dig holes, they cause mayhem. Last year when the irrigation guy came out I asked them to change the controller to run the irrigation in the morning not at night because of the raccoons. I watched the guy get into the controller and seemingly perform the modifications for this request. However, it was not really fixed. I attempted again, I had tried before, to navigate this controllers settings and menus, and alas dear reader, this system is too complicated for me, an unusual thing to admit.\r\n\r\nSo last year I got up every day during the summer that I ran the irrigation (not every day) at 5am and manually ran it to avoid the Rowdy Raccoon Rave in the garden. I did this for four long months, basically May-September. It wasn't fun, but I didn't feel like calling the irrigation guy back, which would have incurred a charge and I just wasn't in the mood to tell this guy that he did his job wrong.\r\n\r\nThis year it was a different guy and he fully admitted the controller is far more complicated than it needs to be, that even he had a hard time figuring it out, and that he tried to make the changes but was unsure, and that if I have issues or it isn't running when I want it to to call him back. He even said he might have to send his supervisor to figure the controller out. I have to tell you I feel so much better about myself after that conversation. And last night, well, this morning, guess what? *The system ran at the right time!* I was making coffee and it started at 5:15am just like he said it would! I am elated, you don't understand, this is so great.\n",

This might include projects and may eventually morph into resuming my newsletter‚Äîwe shall see!\n- I joined the [IndieWeb webring on this microblog](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/22/joined-the-indieweb.html), the first I've joined here. I have [several on weblog](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/webrings), and I'd like to join more!\n- The [blogroll on weblog took its third spin](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/blogroll-spin-3) and I included information about incorporating my microblog into this ritual.\n- I'm still [thinking about cross-posting](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/23/opinion-request-if.html), I still haven't set anything up. I think I will have better momentum on this soon.\n- [I discovered thehtml.review](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/and-i-have.html).\n- I tried to [keep up](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/little-bright-spot.html) with my [Little bright spot](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/31/little-bright-spot.html) series.\n- The Fediverse had another set of rough days where the topic of Threads and Meta dominated. I have many reactions, ranging from disgust to sadness:\n  - [Sigh. I just have zero trust in any goodwill from this company ever.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/sigh-i-just.html)\n  - [I'm taking a small media break.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/27/im-taking-a.html)\n- I made [meaningful updates](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/about-page-updates.html) to my microblog [About page](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/about).\n- I wrote about [various points of progress](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/26/rough-start-to.html).\n- I'm trying out a new \"share\" component on weblog. I really like the idea behind this and [wrote a small blurb](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/29/im-testing-this.html) as well as linked to the post by the author of the component.\n- Added [another part to My ME Life series](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/25/my-me-life.html). This time I jump forward quite a bit in time, but this may be how this series goes.\n- [Discord is taking too much of my attention when I should be blogging!](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/31/im-doing-it.html)\n- I am [regularly listening to Pandora again](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/01/i-cant-fall.html), my many well-curated stations are like tried-and-true old friends. I also added a \"listening to\" section to my [/now page](https://now.anniegreens.lol).\n- I added [a new page to weblog called \"Recommendations\"](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/01/im-compiling-a.html) and, no, [not the same recommendations as what Micro.blog calls blogrolls](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/02/i-realized-last.html).\n- Aaaand we're on a new [photo challenge](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/challenge/) and I couldn't be happier about it!\n- I get [a little upset sometimes about folks not providing alt text for images](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/03/i-am-on.html).\n\nI think that'll do it for now. Hopefully I will not let another month go by before publishing another note.\n\nTake care and have a great week!\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since the first actual post in this series, <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/my-me-life.html\">&ldquo;some early childhood&rdquo;</a>, my brain went to my last job. So, I&rsquo;m obviously jumping around quite a bit. I think there are several reasons for this. Nothing is a straight line, and most definitely not in my life. I think some parts of my life have had larger influences on the whole, and then of course there are contemporary events that make me think back to certain periods. My last job is one of them, as I&rsquo;m still reeling from that time period.</p>\n<p>I <em>was</em> working at what was supposed to be my dream job. I had left the job prior to that feeling dissatisfied and taken for granted. During my annual review I came prepared with my accomplishments, strengths, and plans for the next year, coupled with demands for a merit/salary increase. While they agreed to the first part of the equation, they did not agree to the second. So, I went packing and applied like a &ldquo;cold call&rdquo; to a place that I had always admired, a place I thought of as a pinnacle in the open source community I was a part of.</p>\n<p>When I put in my notice at the other place, guess what happened? Yeah, they offered me the salary I had asked for. Too late, my dream job offered me a 12% increase over that! But as with most things you place on a pedestal, they rarely live up to the ideals you imagined, and my dream job ended spectacularly. Over the years, and especially in the immediate aftermath, I thought I should write a book about the experience. I guess whatever I write here will have to serve as that now.</p>\n<p>It was Labor Day weekend and we all got notice to be in the office by 9am the following week for an important announcement. This email came in <em>during</em> the holiday weekend, if I recall correctly. It may have actually made reference to a &ldquo;big new project&rdquo;. The big new project? The business was shuttering. But what happened when we returned to the office from the weekend went even further.</p>\n<p>Not only was the business shuttering, but the middle management had known about this for some time and were doing all they could to save us, the workers, from having to scramble to find jobs on short notice, and, possibly worse, compete with each other applying to similar places. The work we did on the platform we used could very well end up that way. But I think how it actually went may have added insult to injury.</p>\n<p>We were faced with what I can only describe as a panel of executives. If that makes you want to cry, well, yes, I did some crying later that day. For all of the &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; feelings this dug up in me, having left a job only a year earlier after feeling unappreciated and then only after threatening to leave was told &ldquo;yeah, sure we&rsquo;ll pay you what you think you are worth&rdquo;, this was bringing up a lot of bad feelings. I had come to this company with stars in my eyes, a company whose tagline was &ldquo;Technology for Good&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d spent a year working on a new platform for AmeriCorps VISTA.</p>\n<p>This panel of executives was from a company based in Washington, DC, and they worked on giant platforms (using the same software we did) but it was anything but technology for good. Even before acquiring the dream job, this company had opened an office in Portland and garnered a reputation for paying high salaries but expecting workers to trash their work/life balance. I felt cornered, to put it mildly. The panel was there for the week, and they would be interviewing us all as an on-the-spot job application, so to speak. No, I&rsquo;m not joking. The next day I came in and was put into a small room with two guys, one I sort of knew from the tech meetup scene, and the other one was one of the owners of the company from DC.</p>\n<p>The interview left me feeling all the things: imposter syndrome, like all my eggs were in this one basket, was I stuck in some contract that prevented me from looking elsewhere? Of course, you could choose not to apply and just finish out the month at our current company, as that is what the arrangement was: the current company would shutter at the end of September. You would interview with the new company, and if approved for a position, would spend that month &ldquo;working&rdquo; for them on a contract basis. Then we would all find out at the beginning of October if we had permanent full-time positions with them. It was hell. I felt like I was living on pins and needles for a month. It was like an ouf-of-body experience. I had to put feelers out there and see what other positions were viable lest I find myself hanging without a hope in a month.</p>\n<p>And I did that, but I didn&rsquo;t actually end up finding an alternative.

Something that came up spur-of-the-moment was adding a fun little web component that takes the URL to a Mastodon post and outputs a blockquote of the post with tallies of the interactions on the post (repost/reply/favorite). This is especially useful for Mastodon posts that share a blog post, as putting this at the end of your blog post serves as a &ldquo;Discuss on Mastodon&rdquo; prompt in lieu of comments or Webmentions, which is a whole other topic touched on briefly <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component\">in this post</a>.</li>\n<li>A little while back (mid-February) a post of mine made it into the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/d.umn.edu/g/webdev\">UMN web design newsletter</a>. This gets posted to Mastodon every time including all the authors who were included and I ended up getting a mention here on Micro.blog. But a little while later, it disappeared from my mentions.

Hey, that's the point of \"some day!\" And speaking of notes, I have some \"notes\" for you this round üòâ\n\n<!--more-->\n\nEvery time I get to one of these I have to rewind my life and try to remember what the heck I did, where I went, what might be noteworthy‚Äîthere's that word \"note\" again, I can't escape it‚Äîand I find myself using my blog posts across my now numerous blogs to retrace the steps I've taken.

Something that came up spur-of-the-moment was adding a fun little web component that takes the URL to a Mastodon post and outputs a blockquote of the post with tallies of the interactions on the post (repost/reply/favorite). This is especially useful for Mastodon posts that share a blog post, as putting this at the end of your blog post serves as a \"Discuss on Mastodon\" prompt in lieu of comments or Webmentions, which is a whole other topic touched on briefly [in this post](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/adding-discuss-on-mastodon-web-component).\n- A little while back (mid-February) a post of mine made it into the [UMN web design newsletter](https://groups.google.com/a/d.umn.edu/g/webdev).

Here's a [write-up](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/creating-domain-map).\n- After adding the \"Discuss on Mastodon\" component to weblog, I [compared the interaction options](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/02/27/post-interactions-between.html) with microblog and determined they have great parity.\n- I am the queen of series, apparently, and I can't leave well enough alone!

Of course, I think this will get better as time goes on, not only because I&rsquo;ll get more used to writing about this stuff, but I&rsquo;ll also be getting closer in time to what I recall more easily.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m GenX, a mid-70s baby, just barely missed the US&rsquo;s bicentennial. My birthday also falls just short of Christmas. Apparently I came home in a stocking. I was a big baby and a very fast grower as an infant and toddler. You know how families do the measure-on-the-wall thing with a line? I passed up my sister in grade school. She is five years older than me.</p>\n<p>I remember being 5 foot 4 inches in fourth grade. By the time I left elementary school I was already nearly 5 foot 8 inches. I started playing basketball in fifth grade. We had those grade school fitness tests every year and from fourth grade on I beat everyone, even the guys, at the running event. I didn&rsquo;t start running for sport until junior high, but I was also a long distance cyclist and backpacker for quite a while with my father, uncles, and cousins. More on this as this series continues.</p>\n<p>My older sister resented me from the beginning and that relationship has never improved. When I was born we lived in a neighborhood in town with lots of neighbors and other kids to play with. I have a few early memories from that time period. Things like a small creek running along the side of our property, and a tree with a rope swing, as well as a rustic split-wood fence.</p>\n<p>The garage had a small dirty bathroom in it and I can recall being out there at least a few times. The bathroom in the house had dusty pink fixtures, I remember taking baths in the bathtub. Off the back side of the house was a family room addition with a free-standing wood fireplace, one of those black metal jobs that were very popular from about the late &rsquo;60s through 1980s. I spent a lot of time in the family room, it was where I had all my toys and the time living in that house was all pre-school, even pre-preschool and kindergarten.</p>\n<p>The friends we had there were mostly my sisters since I was so little (&lt;2 years old) but I still remember a few of them. One lady used to babysit us, name was Kelley, and we have a cookie recipe that we used to make called Kelley Cookies. There was a family of boys down the way that we used to play with too, and at the end of the road was a large erratic, common in this part of the country, either from volcanic activity locally or from being washed down from the Missoula Floods along the Columbia River. We&rsquo;d play on that hillside in the dirt and mud all the time and make a mess of ourselves. In fact, there are pictures of me from that time eating dirt, mud, and rocks.</p>\n<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what is wrong with me.</p>",

Of course, I think this will get better as time goes on, not only because I'll get more used to writing about this stuff, but I'll also be getting closer in time to what I recall more easily.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI'm GenX, a mid-70s baby, just barely missed the US's bicentennial. My birthday also falls just short of Christmas. Apparently I came home in a stocking. I was a big baby and a very fast grower as an infant and toddler. You know how families do the measure-on-the-wall thing with a line? I passed up my sister in grade school. She is five years older than me.\n\nI remember being 5 foot 4 inches in fourth grade. By the time I left elementary school I was already nearly 5 foot 8 inches. I started playing basketball in fifth grade. We had those grade school fitness tests every year and from fourth grade on I beat everyone, even the guys, at the running event. I didn't start running for sport until junior high, but I was also a long distance cyclist and backpacker for quite a while with my father, uncles, and cousins. More on this as this series continues.\n\nMy older sister resented me from the beginning and that relationship has never improved. When I was born we lived in a neighborhood in town with lots of neighbors and other kids to play with. I have a few early memories from that time period. Things like a small creek running along the side of our property, and a tree with a rope swing, as well as a rustic split-wood fence.\n\nThe garage had a small dirty bathroom in it and I can recall being out there at least a few times. The bathroom in the house had dusty pink fixtures, I remember taking baths in the bathtub. Off the back side of the house was a family room addition with a free-standing wood fireplace, one of those black metal jobs that were very popular from about the late '60s through 1980s. I spent a lot of time in the family room, it was where I had all my toys and the time living in that house was all pre-school, even pre-preschool and kindergarten.\n\nThe friends we had there were mostly my sisters since I was so little (<2 years old) but I still remember a few of them. One lady used to babysit us, name was Kelley, and we have a cookie recipe that we used to make called Kelley Cookies. There was a family of boys down the way that we used to play with too, and at the end of the road was a large erratic, common in this part of the country, either from volcanic activity locally or from being washed down from the Missoula Floods along the Columbia River. We'd play on that hillside in the dirt and mud all the time and make a mess of ourselves. In fact, there are pictures of me from that time eating dirt, mud, and rocks.\n\nMaybe that's what is wrong with me.\n",

If I&rsquo;m honest with myself, it was hard to write because when I started writing it in December I still truly believed it and felt it. But over the course of the past two months my feelings have gone sour again.</p>\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite place my finger on it. I know what it is now.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s capitalism&rsquo;s ugly greed and all-consuming obsession with AI and attempts at shoving it into every single place it can be shoved (and more!) coupled with massive layoffs all over media and technology. I am disgusted, I am demoralized, again, by an industry that could do so much good, has such good people working in it, but is beholden, like everything else, to the ravenous appetite for profit that is killing everything on this planet.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to fight this in my tiny little corner of the internet because even we are being attacked.

It also means that on days like today <em>you are their lifeline</em> as there is nothing else out there for them right now. Anna&rsquo;s feed on nectar, but they also feed on small insects, they are quite talented bug catchers. There are no bugs out and about today, and very few things blooming. So the feeders <em>must</em> be rotated as they freeze.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m on my 5th or 6th rotation for the day. I finally upped my sugar ratio to give them a little more pep, but also act as an antifreeze. It may or may not be making a difference. This time I also decided to experiment with Christmas lights to see if that would create a little extra warmth to keep the juice from freezing up. Also unsure as to how effective it has been, but the hummingbird appears to <em>like</em> the lights! He has been sitting on the bulbs in various places all day.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Tonight I&rsquo;ll bring both feeders inside after dark, and return one of them before they come in the morning.

And if you are \"known\" as a regular feeder changer, that is, you don't let it run dry, or get sticky and dangerous, or let it grow mold and bacteria, you will be rewarded by having a \"resident\" in your yard.\n\nI've pretty much had a resident Mr and Ms Anna's since about 2018, when I really started paying attention and being serious about keeping my feeders filled and cleaned. It also means that on days like today *you are their lifeline* as there is nothing else out there for them right now. Anna's feed on nectar, but they also feed on small insects, they are quite talented bug catchers. There are no bugs out and about today, and very few things blooming. So the feeders *must* be rotated as they freeze.\n\nI'm on my 5th or 6th rotation for the day. I finally upped my sugar ratio to give them a little more pep, but also act as an antifreeze. It may or may not be making a difference. This time I also decided to experiment with Christmas lights to see if that would create a little extra warmth to keep the juice from freezing up. Also unsure as to how effective it has been, but the hummingbird appears to *like* the lights! He has been sitting on the bulbs in various places all day.\n\n<img class=\"img-flow\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/100386/2024/5998b94a61.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"893\" alt=\"A hummingbird feeder with Christmas lights wrapped around it and a hummingbird sitting on one of the lightbulbs, a garden and a few painted outbuildings are in the background.\">\n\nTonight I'll bring both feeders inside after dark, and return one of them before they come in the morning. We should warm up to at least the mid-20s tomorrow, warm enough that the larger feeder should stay thawed most of the day. I'll have to keep an eye on it. But our nights will continue to get into the teens for a few more days.\n\nTough to decide whether 15¬∞F and snow/sleet/wind is preferable to 116¬∞F during a heatdome. I'd rather have 60¬∞F and slight overcast, to be honest.\n",

I think this is just about perfect: pokes fun at the thing but at the same time gives me permission to go with it. My favorite type of naming.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>\n<p>As with the previous three years, 2023 has been a tough one. The world just wants to move on from something that refuses to move on from them. Denials on the continued spread of a disease that is killing and disabling thousands is on all of us and should sit with you during this season. Many people will stay home alone due to conditions they already have that prevent them from even taking a chance of catching it lest it make them worse, or kill them. Many more will gather with supposed loved ones and spread that disease, knowingly or unknowingly. I don&rsquo;t know how we tackle some of our existential societal challenges if we can&rsquo;t even agree on this. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say on it. This is one of the hardest times in my life and I&rsquo;ve lost so much faith in my fellow humans.</p>\n<p>On a much more positive note, though I will not go as extensively into it as I will in an upcoming weblog post, I sort of fell into joining a few online &ldquo;communities&rdquo; this year. I spent 18 months in 2018 and 2019 in the worst stages of burnout at a job I&rsquo;d ever encountered. It broke me so badly, and then was followed up by a global pandemic and waves of intense hiring and firing, that I had basically vowed to never work in the industry again. I went <em>years</em> without writing a single line of code. I fell into omg.lol in late January 2023 after: a) coming across the social.lol Mastodon instance and wanting to join it, and b) hearing the Do By Friday episode where they talked about it.</p>\n<p>I then also signed up for Micro.blog, but forgot about it (I have talked about this elsewhere before) until the summer when I finally subscribed and got moving on incorporating a microblog into the rest of my web life. Over the next 11 months I&rsquo;ve pretty much changed my whole feeling on the web and tech industry. I&rsquo;ve jumped back in with some reservations and boundaries that I will attempt to hold onto lest I fall into the same traps that burned me before. I am concentrating on the small, intentional, and independent web and purposely avoiding the capitalist web. If I hope to ever work on the web again, it won&rsquo;t be <em>for</em> but rather <em>with.</em> An important distinction. I will not let capitalism consume my remaining years.</p>\n<p>This year has also seen some hard times in my family. I&rsquo;m getting up there in age, but my parents are <em>really</em> getting up there in age. My father is now the primary caretaker of house and home, where it was always my mother before her recent health issues. He&rsquo;s having to learn how to do everything that he never had to do before. She&rsquo;s cognitively declining but also fighting a body that is slowly deteriorating beneath her. Eventually I will need to be closer to them as my father is going to start to fail at some point too.

I really never thought I would do it, but I did! It was quite an experience. I ended the month having written over 25,000 words and writing 30 blog posts split (not evenly) between weblog and my microblog. I&rsquo;ve had some incredible traffic on weblog and some quite popular posts. One post was featured in a popular front-end curated newsletter (Friday Front-end).

What I do want to explore, though, is an experience, or set of experiences, from yesterday.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of stuff: baked some muffins, watched some TV, did some yard work, housekeeping, etc. And I worked on a <em>seventh</em> part to a series on microformats I&rsquo;ve published on weblog. As with all NaBloPoMo posts I&rsquo;ve been keeping tally on micro.blog and linking to the weblog posts.</p>\n<p>From the morning until I went to bed I was unable to get any logged-in pages on micro.blog to load for me. They would all time out. So, I was unable to post my tally, though I did complete my weblog post. This morning I killed the session(s) and some cache and tried again and finally got in.</p>\n<p>Also, last night, after publishing my weblog post, I discovered some URLs on weblog weren&rsquo;t getting special characters from the title stripped out. This seemed to start around Wednesday this week, but I had only noticed it yesterday. It was only affecting two posts to begin with.

What I do want to explore, though, is an experience, or set of experiences, from yesterday.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYesterday I did a bunch of stuff: baked some muffins, watched some TV, did some yard work, housekeeping, etc. And I worked on a *seventh* part to a series on microformats I've published on weblog. As with all NaBloPoMo posts I've been keeping tally on micro.blog and linking to the weblog posts.\n\nFrom the morning until I went to bed I was unable to get any logged-in pages on micro.blog to load for me. They would all time out. So, I was unable to post my tally, though I did complete my weblog post. This morning I killed the session(s) and some cache and tried again and finally got in.\n\nAlso, last night, after publishing my weblog post, I discovered some URLs on weblog weren't getting special characters from the title stripped out. This seemed to start around Wednesday this week, but I had only noticed it yesterday. It was only affecting two posts to begin with. But once I edited a previous post to add a link to the new post in the series, that post too was affected. Something in configuration was probably changed that I didn't have control over. I'm sure it will get resolved, but in the meantime I needed to make some changes of my own so that readers weren't hitting 404s.\n\nI added a few \"URL map\" entries to weblog config, so that anyone hitting the old URLs would get the posts. However, without remembering this happens, after saving the config, *ALL* weblog posts had their URLs updated, and any special characters in their titles were then in the URLs üò±.

Not only as careful, but as honest as I would need them to be. People don&rsquo;t want to always share their carelessness or mistakes and that honesty is life or death to immunocompromised people.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also grateful my home has the space for a garden. I have painted this garden like a canvas, every single plant I put in myself (or via the gardener I used to have help me when I was still working full-time and had less expendable time to spend working in the yard). Now I do it all myself, all maintenance, except for some of the trees I can&rsquo;t get to, which is really only the street trees and the neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree that hangs over my garage.</p>\n<p>The garden has also been the thing that pulled me through burnout, the continuing pandemic, health issues, struggles with my aging parents, tribulations with city living, and a whole host of other things. Escaping into my garden is a joy that is irreplaceable, a salve that can calm even the worst of days.</p>\n<p>Even though the climate is changing fast, I&rsquo;m thankful for the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s still mostly mild temperate climate, its immense beauty, and inviting outdoor activities. I&rsquo;m thankful and remorseful for those who came before us, who ceded land that they never believed they owned, for promises white man has never kept.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m mostly surrounded by open-minded liberals and a neighborhood of people that I get along with and look out for each other.

When I bought the house, the two rooms were finished: one room had tacky paneling and was basically a very large room for storage with two porthole windows over the front porch; the back room was a nicely finished bedroom with carpet, plaster walls, a nice sized walk-in closet and three large windows facing out over the backyard. But none of it was climate controlled, updated, or ecological.</p>\n<p>When I had a whole home energy upgrade in the first couple years of living here, I had them tear it all out. Replaced all the windows with energy efficient windows. Updated all the electrical. Had the old furnace chimney dismantled all the way down three floors to the basement and ran updated HVAC up (there was zero previous heating/cooling on the top floor prior). And had spray foam and rigid foam insulation installed throughout.</p>\n<p>So, the area up there is more comfortable than it ever was before, though it is &ldquo;technically&rdquo; not finished anymore due to there being no sheetrock or other wall surface. The original wood floor in the &ldquo;bedroom&rdquo; part has been revealed under the carpet that was there. The stairwell is tongue and groove wood panelling, which I really like and wouldn&rsquo;t mind having all the way into the bedroom. The framing for the closet is still in place, and I have all the original doors and hardware still. It really just needs wall covering and window trim.</p>\n<p>This is now a priority as in the subsequent years I have started using the space more and more. I first started using it as an office away from my home office on the ground floor. Mostly to &ldquo;get away&rdquo;, as it is so quiet up there and it gives a different perspective facing out the back of the house over the trees. Also, as the magnolia tree that I planted in 2013 has become a Real Tree now, it really does feel like a treehouse up there and I quite love it.</p>\n<p>Lately, over the course of the pandemic, being home more and more, I started sleeping up there too. Mostly during the winter since I love hearing the rain on the roof. My bedroom in my childhood home was upstairs too and that is a sound I miss hearing at night. I made the bedroom into a &ldquo;guest room&rdquo; with a twin bed that I use when I sleep up there and I usually get some of the best sleep when I&rsquo;m up there.</p>\n<p>What I was waiting on was funds to push out a dormer and install a master bath above the main floor bath, before finishing the walls and trim. But that may be unlikely in my current financial situation as well as the length of time I might remain here, which is unknown. It is still likely that could be done, but finishing the space as it is is priority now: walls and trim, paint, light fixtures, finish wood floors. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do anything with the other room than leave it as storage for now.</p>\n<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been sleeping up there, though, I wanted for some privacy, even though it is unlikely there is anyone able to see in. I do look across to my neighbor&rsquo;s upstairs dormer, but I can&rsquo;t see into it so I doubt they can see into mine across the distance of our two backyards combined. Still, I decided to rig something up today. I put up some Command hooks and took a clean drop cloth and used four binder clips (I&rsquo;m still amazed that I come up with new uses for these‚Äîso versatile!) and have a rough privacy curtain but can still see out the top half of the double hung window in the middle when standing. I sort of love it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Also, as the magnolia tree that I planted in 2013 has become a Real Tree now, it really does feel like a treehouse up there and I quite love it.\r\n\r\nLately, over the course of the pandemic, being home more and more, I started sleeping up there too. Mostly during the winter since I love hearing the rain on the roof. My bedroom in my childhood home was upstairs too and that is a sound I miss hearing at night. I made the bedroom into a \"guest room\" with a twin bed that I use when I sleep up there and I usually get some of the best sleep when I'm up there.\r\n\r\nWhat I was waiting on was funds to push out a dormer and install a master bath above the main floor bath, before finishing the walls and trim. But that may be unlikely in my current financial situation as well as the length of time I might remain here, which is unknown. It is still likely that could be done, but finishing the space as it is is priority now: walls and trim, paint, light fixtures, finish wood floors. I'm not sure I'll do anything with the other room than leave it as storage for now.\r\n\r\nSince I've been sleeping up there, though, I wanted for some privacy, even though it is unlikely there is anyone able to see in. I do look across to my neighbor's upstairs dormer, but I can't see into it so I doubt they can see into mine across the distance of our two backyards combined. Still, I decided to rig something up today. I put up some Command hooks and took a clean drop cloth and used four binder clips (I'm still amazed that I come up with new uses for these‚Äîso versatile!) and have a rough privacy curtain but can still see out the top half of the double hung window in the middle when standing. I sort of love it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"img-flow\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/100386/2023/2e6fcda605.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Facing three windows, two casements on either side of a double hung, with a gabled roof pitch visible on either side and over the top. There is a tan colored drop cloth hung across the windows covering the casement windows and just the bottom half of the double hung. To the right is a white wood stair railing. Out the top of the double hung window is a dormer of a house in the distance.\">\n",

What do I have for you today?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&rsquo;m considering a <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/09/looking-for-photos.html\">new mini photo series</a> on my microblog. This came about from seeing a post by <a href=\"https://its.puddingtime.org/2023/10/09/camped-at-nehalem.html\">@mph</a> about his recent stop at Camp 18 and he shared more photos from over the years. This had me searching for my photos from Camp 18 and I eventually used &ldquo;chandelier&rdquo; as a search term in Photos and now want to share all my glorious ceilings, chandeliers, and light fixtures, from lots of places, which I have far more of than I expected. More on this to come!</li>\n<li>I finished my <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/manual-of-me\">Manual of Me</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working on this for quite a while, probably more therapy for myself than something for anyone else to gain value from, but who knows. If I ever hope to work again, outside of health limitations that may endure, I need to get back into a headspace that I haven&rsquo;t been in for some time. I think working through these sections and thinking back to what challenges I had at my last job and what I would hope to get from a new job was an important step.</li>\n<li>I wrote an <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/accessibility-statement\">Accessibility Statement</a> for weblog.

This came about from seeing a post by [@mph](https://its.puddingtime.org/2023/10/09/camped-at-nehalem.html) about his recent stop at Camp 18 and he shared more photos from over the years. This had me searching for my photos from Camp 18 and I eventually used \"chandelier\" as a search term in Photos and now want to share all my glorious ceilings, chandeliers, and light fixtures, from lots of places, which I have far more of than I expected. More on this to come!\n- I finished my [Manual of Me](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/manual-of-me). I've been working on this for quite a while, probably more therapy for myself than something for anyone else to gain value from, but who knows.

I think working through these sections and thinking back to what challenges I had at my last job and what I would hope to get from a new job was an important step.\n- I wrote an [Accessibility Statement](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/accessibility-statement) for weblog.

				"content_html": "<p>Without really planning it, the some day note seems to occur about every two weeks. That&rsquo;s about the right regularity for me without trying too hard, so I&rsquo;m happy with how that&rsquo;s working out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fall! Portland and the PNW has entered fall, both on the calendar but also &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo;. Starting this past weekend, the very first atmospheric river of the season came right at us and produced three days of fairly substantial rainfall. I know a lot of people in this country and around the world like to stereotype Portland (and Seattle) as raining all the time, but that simply is not true. And lately with climate change, it is even less true. Measurable rain is anything above 1/10th of an inch. Since April 25, 2023, there have only been five days of measurable rain in Portland. That is five months of basically no rain, not rain all the time, folks. This time of year we actually yearn for rain. We&rsquo;ve just endured months and months of drought and wildfire, hot weather and dry yards. So I always come back to an essay from about ten years ago written by a guy in Seattle called &ldquo;Ready For Rain&rdquo;. It was originally <a href=\"https://leelefever.medium.com/ready-for-rain-f14703d4f4a8\">published on Medium</a>, but he seems to have moved it to <a href=\"https://leelefever.com/inspiration-ready-for-rain/\">his own site</a> now as well.</li>\n<li>I earned my last remaining two Microblog pins: Micro Monday and Night Owl! Completely meaningless, but hey, we have to aim for something in life, right?</li>\n<li>Before those last two pins, I still needed to earn the pin for Bookshelves, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d ever get. I read, but it is very sporadic with my illness, trying to keep track of anything I read is like shooting in the dark. My available spoons and ability to withstand visual stress like reading an entire book is not worth it much of the time. However, I was seeking a hummingbird book that I had been trying to get my hands on, and while hoping to find it available on Libby through Multnomah County Library, ended up finding and reading <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/finished-reading-fastest.html\">Fastest Things on Wings</a>. What a fulfilling experience that was.</li>\n<li>I watched all of season two and three (except for the last episode, yet to come out as of this writing) of Reservation Dogs. The episode called &ldquo;Elora&rsquo;s Dad&rdquo; was excellent and I made <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/ethan-hawke-as.html\">a small post</a> about it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/18/i-deactivated-my.html\">I deactivated my Twitter account</a>. It was beyond time. The platform is more of a cesspool than it has ever been and rather a security risk. I&rsquo;m not going to harp on anyone who still uses it but folks really need to be aware of the exposure it puts on you and your information. Since Musk took over, I have had more spam and fraud on my mobile number and associated email address used by that Twitter account than ever before. I know it is from being on that account because I don&rsquo;t share this number or address with very many people. All of the content you put on there has been leaked and given to bad actors and you better believe it will probably come back to haunt you if they can get something out of it. Musk is a bad man that supports efforts to destroy democracies and support autocracies. You shouldn&rsquo;t want to be a part of that.</li>\n<li>I read about <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/16/a-brief-history.html\">Digital Gardens</a> in an older blog post by Maggie Appleton. It is excellent and prompted me to <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/works-in-progress\">write about what I&rsquo;m writing about</a>, what I have in progress and want to finish.</li>\n<li>I joined the Tinylytics webring on weblog and fought with my small-town credit union over the monthly fraud alert saga ensuing from the recurring foreign transaction to pay Tinylytics. Vincent is amazing and has worked with me to get this right and I&rsquo;m now just going to pay him upfront for a whole year and avoid this headache.

				"content_text": "Without really planning it, the some day note seems to occur about every two weeks. That's about the right regularity for me without trying too hard, so I'm happy with how that's working out.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n- Fall! Portland and the PNW has entered fall, both on the calendar but also \"on the ground\". Starting this past weekend, the very first atmospheric river of the season came right at us and produced three days of fairly substantial rainfall. I know a lot of people in this country and around the world like to stereotype Portland (and Seattle) as raining all the time, but that simply is not true. And lately with climate change, it is even less true. Measurable rain is anything above 1/10th of an inch. Since April 25, 2023, there have only been five days of measurable rain in Portland. That is five months of basically no rain, not rain all the time, folks. This time of year we actually yearn for rain. We've just endured months and months of drought and wildfire, hot weather and dry yards. So I always come back to an essay from about ten years ago written by a guy in Seattle called \"Ready For Rain\". It was originally [published on Medium](https://leelefever.medium.com/ready-for-rain-f14703d4f4a8), but he seems to have moved it to [his own site](https://leelefever.com/inspiration-ready-for-rain/) now as well.\n- I earned my last remaining two Microblog pins: Micro Monday and Night Owl! Completely meaningless, but hey, we have to aim for something in life, right?\n- Before those last two pins, I still needed to earn the pin for Bookshelves, which I wasn't sure I'd ever get. I read, but it is very sporadic with my illness, trying to keep track of anything I read is like shooting in the dark. My available spoons and ability to withstand visual stress like reading an entire book is not worth it much of the time. However, I was seeking a hummingbird book that I had been trying to get my hands on, and while hoping to find it available on Libby through Multnomah County Library, ended up finding and reading [Fastest Things on Wings](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/finished-reading-fastest.html). What a fulfilling experience that was.\n- I watched all of season two and three (except for the last episode, yet to come out as of this writing) of Reservation Dogs. The episode called \"Elora's Dad\" was excellent and I made [a small post](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/21/ethan-hawke-as.html) about it.\n- [I deactivated my Twitter account](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/18/i-deactivated-my.html). It was beyond time. The platform is more of a cesspool than it has ever been and rather a security risk. I'm not going to harp on anyone who still uses it but folks really need to be aware of the exposure it puts on you and your information. Since Musk took over, I have had more spam and fraud on my mobile number and associated email address used by that Twitter account than ever before. I know it is from being on that account because I don't share this number or address with very many people. All of the content you put on there has been leaked and given to bad actors and you better believe it will probably come back to haunt you if they can get something out of it. Musk is a bad man that supports efforts to destroy democracies and support autocracies. You shouldn't want to be a part of that.\n- I read about [Digital Gardens](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/16/a-brief-history.html) in an older blog post by Maggie Appleton. It is excellent and prompted me to [write about what I'm writing about](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/works-in-progress), what I have in progress and want to finish.\n- I joined the Tinylytics webring on weblog and fought with my small-town credit union over the monthly fraud alert saga ensuing from the recurring foreign transaction to pay Tinylytics. Vincent is amazing and has worked with me to get this right and I'm now just going to pay him upfront for a whole year and avoid this headache. If it wasn't for the grandfathered very low fixed APR on this card I wouldn't put up with it. But this rate is basically unheard of anymore, and I've had the card since I was 18 (30 years).\n- [Wordpress now has an ActivityPub plugin](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/14/saw-this-post.html) to make a blog compatible with the Fediverse and provide comments that will work as replies. I've not only discovered that I already have a Wordpress.com account and blog (I never did much with it), but I also have a Wordpress blog on my ancient domain/hosting that I haven't used since I was in college, yet still pay for. So now I have gears working in my head for another \"thing\" though not sure what yet. Do I need *another* blog?! Maybe this is where my newsletter will end up? I'm sure I'll have more to say on this at some point.\n\nThis was a long one, thanks for sticking around. Take care and have a great week!\n",

That&rsquo;s gotta be worth something, even if it is erroneous üòÜ</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see what I can come up with on today&rsquo;s installment of Some Day Notes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&rsquo;m participating in the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/discover/mbsept/grid\">September micro.blog photo challenge</a>. I participated in the March challenge as well, earlier this year, but that was before I &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; I had a micro.blog and started using it. In March I relied largely on my library of photos. This time around I am trying to take contemporary photos, while still relying somewhat on my library.</li>\n<li>I added one of my favorite recipes to weblog, where I occasionally document them with my favorite additions and modifications. This time around it is <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/08/creamy-baked-potatoes\">Creamy Baked Potatoes</a> with a time-tested slew of seasonings that will knock your socks off during bake time, the smell is amazing.</li>\n<li>I also published a new weblog post, though it is related to a previous post, in that I had intended to expand on a subject mentioned and then forgot. This is about <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/adding-microblogging-feeds-to-weblog\">Adding microblogging feeds to weblog</a>.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve been revisiting some Agatha Christie adaptations for TV and film. A few of them are what are being referred to as &ldquo;Alternative History Dramas&rdquo; that I cannot help but roll my eyes at. At least one of them was worthwhile.</li>\n<li>I made another trip to visit family last week. It was nothing remarkable but any time I can visit my aging parents is worthwhile in my book. Each time it is made clear that I will need to move closer to them sooner rather than later.</li>\n<li>We have turned the corner on the seasons in Portland, at least temporarily, as it seems we will get back into the 90s by next weekend. The brief reprieve was nice while it lasted.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve been growing my Mastodon accounts. Though not something I purposefully strive for, one of my smaller and more personal accounts that I primarily use for talking about my chronic illness has seen more activity in the last couple weeks than in the previous eight months I&rsquo;ve had it. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence, as we are in yet another surge of the virus and that always makes content there more abundant and worthy of sharing and talking about.

				"content_text": "I think I've had some successes over the last few weeks, or at least my brain has the view that I have. That's gotta be worth something, even if it is erroneous üòÜ\n\nLet's see what I can come up with on today's installment of Some Day Notes.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n- I'm participating in the [September micro.blog photo challenge](https://micro.blog/discover/mbsept/grid). I participated in the March challenge as well, earlier this year, but that was before I \"remembered\" I had a micro.blog and started using it. In March I relied largely on my library of photos. This time around I am trying to take contemporary photos, while still relying somewhat on my library.\n- I added one of my favorite recipes to weblog, where I occasionally document them with my favorite additions and modifications. This time around it is [Creamy Baked Potatoes](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/08/creamy-baked-potatoes) with a time-tested slew of seasonings that will knock your socks off during bake time, the smell is amazing.\n- I also published a new weblog post, though it is related to a previous post, in that I had intended to expand on a subject mentioned and then forgot. This is about [Adding microblogging feeds to weblog](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/09/adding-microblogging-feeds-to-weblog).\n- I've been revisiting some Agatha Christie adaptations for TV and film. A few of them are what are being referred to as \"Alternative History Dramas\" that I cannot help but roll my eyes at. At least one of them was worthwhile.\n- I made another trip to visit family last week. It was nothing remarkable but any time I can visit my aging parents is worthwhile in my book. Each time it is made clear that I will need to move closer to them sooner rather than later.\n- We have turned the corner on the seasons in Portland, at least temporarily, as it seems we will get back into the 90s by next weekend. The brief reprieve was nice while it lasted.\n- I've been growing my Mastodon accounts. Though not something I purposefully strive for, one of my smaller and more personal accounts that I primarily use for talking about my chronic illness has seen more activity in the last couple weeks than in the previous eight months I've had it. Of course, this isn't a coincidence, as we are in yet another surge of the virus and that always makes content there more abundant and worthy of sharing and talking about. It remains one of the safest spaces on the internet for me.\n- I've also been writing some sporadic...poems? They're more like rhythmic thoughts, but I'm only publishing them to microblog and not the timeline. They're fairly personal and I'm not even sure how I want to capture them long-term. I will probably need to create a category and page some day.\n\nI guess that's it for now. Take care and have a great week!\n",
