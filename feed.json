Shock and awe are all that sells and yet shock and awe cannot even get us to act anymore. I&rsquo;m not sure where I&rsquo;m going with this idea, but over the past few weeks and months, I&rsquo;ve been trying to limit my exposure to most news. Not only can I personally not handle all that I cannot control, it is really dragging me down. I don&rsquo;t want to be desensitized and feel helpless. I want to feel like I have agency over my life and so I think that means being more aware of my intimate surroundings.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes. I&rsquo;ve already cut back greatly on social media. I&rsquo;m currently on a two-week break from blogging to give my brain a break while I finish a five-session CSS workshop. I&rsquo;ve started a small venture for WeblogPoMo Challenges that is very low pressure and at least keeps me interested when I think about it. For NaBloPoMo in November I&rsquo;m going to add the second phase of the challenges I had in mind: an AMA where people can blog about questions they have for fellow bloggers and then other bloggers can respond with posts on their own blogs. I&rsquo;m rather curious how this will go and if it will catch on. I think it could be a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>During these last couple weeks before the election, I hope you&rsquo;re all taking care of yourselves. For the last eight years I just have to check out. I cannot expose myself to the madness, it&rsquo;s too much for my nervous system. 2016 broken me in ways I&rsquo;ve never gotten over. Sometimes I think 2016 was the breaking point where my illness once again started backsliding. I hope we come out of this okay. I hope we don&rsquo;t lose our sensitivities completely. I hope shock and awe becomes less of the norm and more a rarity that we can once again respond to.</p>\n<p>💟</p>\n<hr>\n<p>POSSE copies:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",

Shock and awe are all that sells and yet shock and awe cannot even get us to act anymore. I'm not sure where I'm going with this idea, but over the past few weeks and months, I've been trying to limit my exposure to most news. Not only can I personally not handle all that I cannot control, it is really dragging me down. I don't want to be desensitized and feel helpless. I want to feel like I have agency over my life and so I think that means being more aware of my intimate surroundings.\n\nLet's see how this goes. I've already cut back greatly on social media. I'm currently on a two-week break from blogging to give my brain a break while I finish a five-session CSS workshop. I've started a small venture for WeblogPoMo Challenges that is very low pressure and at least keeps me interested when I think about it. For NaBloPoMo in November I'm going to add the second phase of the challenges I had in mind: an AMA where people can blog about questions they have for fellow bloggers and then other bloggers can respond with posts on their own blogs. I'm rather curious how this will go and if it will catch on. I think it could be a lot of fun.\n\nDuring these last couple weeks before the election, I hope you're all taking care of yourselves. For the last eight years I just have to check out. I cannot expose myself to the madness, it's too much for my nervous system. 2016 broken me in ways I've never gotten over. Sometimes I think 2016 was the breaking point where my illness once again started backsliding. I hope we come out of this okay. I hope we don't lose our sensitivities completely. I hope shock and awe becomes less of the norm and more a rarity that we can once again respond to.\n\n💟\n\n---\n\nPOSSE copies:\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://social.lol/@anniegreens/113369647546041463\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on social.lol</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of pacing in the context of living with an energy-limiting illness like ME/CFS. Maybe you haven&rsquo;t heard of pacing. If you want to understand why pacing is even a thing, you need to only think about the fact that there are no approved treatments and no cure for ME/CFS. Without pacing we would be in a constant state of crash and likely never return to our baseline ever again, perhaps increasingly worsening that baseline until we enter a more severe state of the illness. It&rsquo;s as grim as it sounds.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.meaction.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pacing-and-Management-Guide-for-ME_CFS-9.pdf\">#MEAction Pacing and Management Guide</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pacing is a self-management strategy for activity.

They may plan extra rest ahead of strenuous activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the past two weeks I&rsquo;ve been attending an online CSS workshop. I&rsquo;m sitting still in a chair and listening and watching to a presenter talk about, show examples of, and parse interactions from the attendees about CSS. Sounds pretty easy, right? I&rsquo;ll be quite frank here, this is what trashes my baseline the worst: sustained cognitive functions. First of all, sitting is one of the hardest things to do. Sitting for any length of time can be felt in my head pretty soon after starting. It becomes a dull and then constantly shrill pain, and can lead to migraines and increased tinnitus. Couple that with staring at a screen for hours at a time <em>and</em> listening to and absorbing information, it is a crash recipe in the making.</p>\n<p>Had this workshop been five straight days of sessions, I likely wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend, even remotely in the comfort of my home. Luckily it is on Monday and Tuesday for two weeks, and then the Monday of the third week. Two and a half hours each day with minimal breaks, but broken up across three weeks. It is barely manageable. I am only able to do this because I am pacing. I&rsquo;ve been sleeping 10-12+ hours every night and I&rsquo;ve been limiting my other activities as much as possible.</p>\n<p>For example, today, I&rsquo;ve just finished the morning workshop session and I have two other taxing tasks I&rsquo;d like to complete, but I can only realistically do one. The other one will have to wait until tomorrow or Thursday. What are these other tasks? Surely some gigantic undertaking, right? Well, no. One of them is baking something from scratch, the other is making a phone call that will require a series of back and forth discussions with another person about an intense subject. Both of these are giant tasks for someone with ME/CFS.</p>\n<p>I have been waiting to bake something for three days, my butter and eggs have been sitting on the counter since Sunday. I will choose to do that over the phone call, and that is the only remaining thing I will get done today. If I finish it and rest, maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to do one smaller thing before I go to bed, but I probably won&rsquo;t push it. The thing about crashes is that they usually are delayed by 12+ hours, so I could think I&rsquo;m in the clear and then do another thing only to have a worsened crash tomorrow night into Thursday than if I didn&rsquo;t do anything else. A lot of times it is a waiting game to see how my body reacts and what other external factors might happen out of my control.</p>\n<p>Pacing is imperfect and even after more than 30 years of practice, I still get it wrong. But it is one of the only tools I have available to live my life and get done what I need to get done, even if on an extended or delayed timeline. I&rsquo;ve probably talked about this before, I tend to &ldquo;plan&rdquo; at the week or month stage rather than daily. I set out what I think I need to get done in a week, and that often extends to the following week, but can usually be wrapped up within the month. Imperfect but essential.</p>",

I still think omg.lol wins on this, Adam continues to provide information whenever I ask for it. Just the other day he pulled up info from Stripe in order to create a chart that shows where the highest concentrations of account creations occurred over time.</li>\n<li>I hit <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/11/tomorrows-days-of.html\">75%</a> of my posting goal for 100 Days of Blog. Today I'm even farther, the end of this current challenge is so close.</li>\n<li>I began <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/13/i-am-in.html\">researching digital gardens</a> more seriously and <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/15/if-i-create.html\">making a new microblog</a> as my <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/15/new-microblog-created.html\">Wiki Garden</a>. This hasn't become anything yet but hopefully I will get working on it over the fall and winter months.</li>\n<li>I finally watched the most recent adaptation of <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/16/while-not-exactly.html\"><i>And Then There Were None</i></a>.</li>\n<li>I thought about doing something (soon) for <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/17/i-still-havent.html\">Blogs and Coffee</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/19/im-always-shocked.html\">I asked for support</a> and was surprised how it went. This will definitely become a post on weblog once I have a chance to explore my feelings more.</li>\n<li>I had days where I reveled in <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/20/today-is-the.html\">doing nothing</a> or at least contemplated it.</li>\n<li>I was weirded out by inconsistencies in <a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/09/20/categories-with-more.html\">categories</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### 100 Days of Blog\n\nThis blog continues to be a joy to post to. Perhaps it is because I didn't put any constraints on how I'd use it. I don't have any particular post types. It's sometimes just a daily regurgitation of what has taken place in the day/days before. And other times I write some meaningful words that surprise me. I took a week off from posting this month, but picked it right back up and am facing less than three weeks of posts left to reach the challenge goal.

These are small notes with ephemeral meaning. I have thoughts of improving the notes archive but haven't started working on that yet.\n\n### Weblog Themes/Custom/Styles\n\nI don't think I can say that I did anything on [themes.lol](https://themes.lol) over the last month. I am still mid-authoring of the Shortcodes page and not quite done with HTML element and form styling for [Styles](https://styles.themes.lol/style). I also have a few posts for [Custom](https://custom.themes.lol) that need to be completed. I haven't even posted a September status to the homepage on [Themes](https://themes.lol) yet. So much to do!\n\n### Others\n\nThese are all blogs I have but do not contain anything yet. I'll put some ideas under each.\n\n#### Apple Annie's Wiki Garden\n\nBrand new digital garden spun up as a microblog. My ideas here are still forming. I think I'd like to use the same theme as my main microblog. That really requires me to sever reliance on Tiny Theme as a base. I do not want to deal with regressions on two blogs every time I update the base theme. I have enough experience now customizing themes that I should be able to do this without much issue. The only issue is time.\n\n#### Table for One Cafe\n\nNothing has been done here, sadly. I still love the idea of this blog and combining it with exploration of recipes from my grandmother. Maybe once I get my main microblog and digital garden theme in place, I'll feel more up to creating the custom theme for this blog. That forward movement might be enough to actually do something with it.\n\n#### Blogs and Coffee\n\nThis blog and Tiny Pages are both omg.lol emoji addresses. While Tiny Pages already has some experimentation living on it, which is what its intention is, Blogs and Coffee has nothing yet, only a domain. I mention in a microblog post this month that I'm considering a new blog/site design review for this now. Many people redesign or create new sites and it might be a fun way to dig into details and post about it...while drinking coffee? Ha, see that's still a hangup. I need to make the name make sense. This is the domain name in search of content problem...\n",

All the while, he appeared to be cemented, a statuette constructed within his cow leathered seat.</p>\n<p>Unclenching my fists, I rubbed his desk gently as if waxing it, caring for it, as I propelled myself backwards, plunging into the soft cushioned chair once more. Self-contained to my side of his desk, fastened securely behind his invisible patient-doctor-border.</p>\n<p>When it was clear I wasn’t about to leap forward, he moved slowly toward one of his closed desk drawers, pulled something out, never once taking his eyes off me.</p>\n<p>At least one whole minute passed as he fumbled with whatever was in his hand, his eyes studying me, my eyes staring obstinately back and as the minute drew to a close, I found myself folding my arms once again, waiting for his next litany of meaningless words. Only this time, there were no words.</p>\n<p>Rising from his chair, he walked towards his door, opened it softly, cocked his head toward his receptionist – some silent code no doubt for patients such as me – and then passed whatever had been in his hand to me.  Looking down, I saw the word “Psychotherapist” and he said softly “I suggest you see her, she’s very good, I suggest you make an appointment to discuss your anger issues.”</p>\n<p>Anger issues.</p>\n<p>The only anger I had was toward this small man and he wanted me to pay someone, so as to discuss my anger toward him.</p>\n<p>And so I left his office with a lighter purse, no answers, no plan, no consultant and worst of all, no hope.</p>\n<p>There was no ME God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"quoteback-wrap\">\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-author=\"So Long as I can Breathe\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/falling-apart/\"><p>Falling Apart <a href=\"https://solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/falling-apart/\">solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com</a></p><footer>So Long as I can Breathe <cite><a href=\"https://solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/falling-apart/\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://solongasicanbreathe.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/falling-apart/</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n</div>\n",

Foxglove, the common name here, grows natively on the edge of forests and in the roadside verge. It is quite prolific in the area surrounding my parents garden and I could have easily gotten hands on some seeds or some of this year's seedlings. But the issue with that is that I would be waiting until next year for blooms, as it is a biennial. This spring I ordered six plants from Annie's Annuals and one of them was this hybrid digitalis which promised to bloom the first year, and it is!</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53938588051_559547352f_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53938588051_559547352f_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53938588051_4d524f8f1f_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53938588051_acee3fd807_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53938588051_559547352f_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A digitalis with a bloom stalk opening from the bottom, large fuchsia colored blooms above a healthy rosette of green lance shaped leaves.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A digitalis with a bloom stalk opening from the bottom, large fuchsia colored blooms above a healthy rosette of green lance shaped leaves. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2qbnn34\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The hydrangeas are just about done pushing new bloom heads.

Four of them are the same and are not hard-wired, but I had to replace them all a couple years ago because they all expired, which is still a weird thing to me. I understand there are compounds that age and break down inside of them. This also means you can&rsquo;t just toss them in the trash. The two upstairs are hard-wired so they only have a back-up battery in them. Luckily they all have the same little access panel that slides over to replace the batteries without having to take them off their mounts.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d really love to be able to use the Eve Home smoke detectors because then I&rsquo;d have information about them in my Home app. I&rsquo;d be able to see the status of the batteries and probably when they were last changed. I assume I would also get a notice on my phone or other device letting me know when it is time to change the batteries or which one is going off in the case one goes off.

I'm in the habit of changing them all at the same time any time I need to replace the batteries in one so that I always know how old they all are.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe worst part about this task is that you're up on a step stool or ladder so you can reach the dang things, then you need a hand to push the test button, so you only have one free hand to plug one ear, and then you end up deaf and ringing in the other ear for the next hour or two.\r\n\r\nNow marking on the calendar this date so I in six months I can probably do this all over again. Four of them are the same and are not hard-wired, but I had to replace them all a couple years ago because they all expired, which is still a weird thing to me. I understand there are compounds that age and break down inside of them. This also means you can't just toss them in the trash. The two upstairs are hard-wired so they only have a back-up battery in them. Luckily they all have the same little access panel that slides over to replace the batteries without having to take them off their mounts.\r\n\r\nI'd really love to be able to use the Eve Home smoke detectors because then I'd have information about them in my Home app. I'd be able to see the status of the batteries and probably when they were last changed. I assume I would also get a notice on my phone or other device letting me know when it is time to change the batteries or which one is going off in the case one goes off.

				"title": "My ME Life: Lessons learned from Shingles",
				"content_html": "<p>Today&rsquo;s entry in this series—it has been a while—has me remembering that time I had Shingles. The reason this comes up now is several-fold: many people are seeing themselves having Shingles right now following an initial or repeat Covid infection; I similarly had Shingles during some of my sickest years with ME/CFS prior to a remission; and it is an important lesson in mild or asymptomatic infection still leading to evidence of viral persistence and the long tail of chronic vs acute illness.</p>\n<p>I was in my early- to mid-20s, definitely not what is the expected age for Shingles. In fact, today you can&rsquo;t even get a Shingles vaccine until you are over 50 (unless approved by a doctor). Shingles is caused by the same virus as Chicken Pox. If you had Chicken Pox as a child you have this virus still residing in your body. This is what viruses do. Many common (and not so common) viruses take up residence in reservoirs and tissue and lie in wait to be reactivated later for any number of reasons, usually an additional stress or illness, and then can cause a whole new slew of terrible and more damaging illness than the acute stage of the virus. That is exactly what Long Covid is, by the way.</p>\n<p>Very often the acute state of a viral infection can be mild or asymptomatic. In my case, my sister, a few years older than me, had Chicken Pox. My parents, like many other parents in a wave of copy-cat like behavior, were led to believe the right thing to do was put us together &ldquo;to get it over with&rdquo; so we would both be sick at the same time. I never responded with a symptomatic infection. I never had a breakout of pox/bumps and the associated symptoms of Chicken Pox. Did I <em>have</em> Chicken Pox? Well, yes, because two decades later I had Shingles.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is that even with a mild or asymptomatic viral infection, you can still end up with a chronic condition from that virus. Likewise, you can have a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; or asymptomatic Covid infection and still end up chronically ill and disabled with Long Covid. Many asymptomatic infections are a result of your immune system being <em>unable</em> to mount a response, where your body may already be too sick or damaged to show signs of an infection. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t sick, it likely means more damage, unseen, is occurring within your body.</p>\n<p>My case of Shingles was considered out of the ordinary for someone who appeared to be well, yet with a chronic illness, ME/CFS. Up until the last ten years or so, ME/CFS was still widely ignored and refuted by medical professionals. Some of this still persists today and is being taken up again in the fight to recognize Long Covid. It took me around five years to get any sort of answer about my condition and be told I have ME/CFS. Even afterwards I was psychologized, told to push through it, that the will to get &ldquo;better&rdquo; was in my head and my own fault. With Shingles too I was first told it was a rash, even when I explained the terrible pain I was in.</p>\n<p>Shingles, if untreated, can damage nerves, internal organs, and cause blindness if on the face. This is why it can appear to &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; your body. For me it was on the side of my torso and wrapped around the front to my belly. To this day, I still have lingering pain sometimes and wonder if there is internal damage due to the length of time it took for my doctor to recognize what it was and agree to treat me. Treatment is an anti-viral. If that sounds familiar, that may be because acute treatment of Covid is also an anti-viral. They work to stop viral replication from occurring inside the body. Years ago, and perhaps still today, when I had Shingles, many anti-virals were used to treat common sexually transmitted viruses.</p>\n<p>While I had insurance through a state-run program, the list of approved medicine did <em>not</em> cover these anti-virals specifically because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted viruses. It was like the boards, likely mostly men, sitting around deciding what medication they deemed &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; for people to take should include methods to shame people when they acquired illnesses of &ldquo;ill repute.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I was a young chronically ill person who had already been mistreated and gaslighted so much by the medical profession and now I faced paying $600 out of pocket for an anti-viral to protect my nerves and organs from damage. Is it any wonder I don&rsquo;t trust doctors and healthcare even to this day? They haven&rsquo;t gotten any better looking at how the pandemic is being handled. Depending on the calculator you use, $600 then is over $1100 today, and medication is far more expensive now. I have been seeing people with insurance coverage paying $900 out of pocket for Paxlovid.</p>\n<p>My ME/CFS was also caused by a viral infection, likely Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes Mononucleosis in the acute stage. Many people with Long Covid go on to qualify for the diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS. These post-viral illnesses all act similarly: an acute viral illness followed by some period of time and then another health trigger, either stress or another illness, often viral, that reactivates a virus-in-waiting in the body months or years later, launching the chronic illness stage.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching this happen on repeat for so many years now I have started to see patterns. Following my anti-viral treatment for Shingles I entered a remission in my ME/CFS. No one at the time made any connection, and frankly neither did I. But now I have been reading studies and literature about Long Covid and additional related post-viral illness, and anti-virals can play a key role in these conditions.</p>",

This will allow me to remove the pot from the garden during the rainiest part of the winter; although the echeveria is hardy in my zone, it will not survive cold *and* persistently wet conditions in slow draining soil, which I have with my SE Portland clay soil.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517822_a0862b8b52_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517822_a0862b8b52_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517822_6ac2e7bf66_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517822_69d776815e_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517822_a0862b8b52_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Viewing the layers of a narrow garden bed next to a chain link fence and basalt stepping stone path in river rock, highlighting an orange glazed container with a freshly planted echeveria set into the bed.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>The freshly planted Mexican Snowball in an orange glazed pot set into the sideyard garden. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2q4tetC\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861832995_6b84f3b5dc_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861832995_6b84f3b5dc_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861832995_a390850274_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861832995_b0ec6da66c_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861832995_6b84f3b5dc_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Close up of an orange glazed container with a freshly planted echeveria set into a garden bed.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Close up of the freshly planted Mexican Snowball in an orange glazed pot set into the sideyard garden. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2q4zYr2\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517792_6cdc3b52c9_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517792_6cdc3b52c9_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517792_7eb1520a40_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517792_dae7bc0991_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53860517792_6cdc3b52c9_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Close up of a freshly planted Sedum pachyclados in a garden bed.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Close up of the freshly planted Sedum pachyclados in the sideyard garden. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2q4tet7\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861665148_b0eb46c6fa_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861665148_b0eb46c6fa_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861665148_f1e458f05b_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861665148_d7a943dc29_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53861665148_b0eb46c6fa_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Close up of a freshly planted Sedum Lime Zinger in a garden bed.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Close up of the freshly planted Sedum Lime Zinger in the sideyard garden. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2q4z7x7\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n---\n\nPOSSE copies:\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://mstdn.social/@anniegreens/112798108630152963\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on mstdn.social</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In fact the entire situation was turned around on Adam, who did nothing but stand up for the marginalized person that was being attacked.\n- I watched the entire US King Kong franchise for the first time and posted quotes.\n- I watched some new (to me) TV shows and posted some quotes.\n- I posted quotes from people's blogs, social media posts, other articles on several subjects, including AI, tech, the web, chronic illness, health and sickness, and climate change and severe weather events.\n- You should probably just check out my [Quote](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/quote/) category because there are too many to list here.\n- I posted other pictures from my garden:\n  - [🌱 Two salvias in opposing corners of the backyard.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/06/two-salvias-in.html)\n  - [Side yard comparison, year-to-year.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/07/side-yard-comparison.html)\n- I had several tough weeks.\n- I posted about starting a new challenge and finding a theme issue: [I started 100 Days to Offload challenge today.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/10/i-started-days.html)\n- I found meaning in a blog post to help me think through the previously mentioned kerfuffle: [On Accountability](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/13/on-accountability.html)\n- I watched season three of Bridgerton and crushed on Colin.\n- I posted more about AI: [I don't want attribution.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/18/i-dont-want.html)\n- I found something I felt to be out of place on a Micro.blog theme and wrote about it: [I hope I word this okay.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/19/i-hope-i.html)\n- I ordered and received some plants from Annie's Annuals and Perennials. I've yet to get them in the ground due to the heatwave. Crossing my fingers to get it done this weekend.\n- I was grossed out by some content on a Youtube channel I've subscribed to for quite a while and I've stopped subscribing. When people show you who they are, believe them.\n- The debate was a turning point, nothing has gone well since, and I'm glad I did not watch it: [I am not interested in anything that comes from tomorrow's debate.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/26/i-am-not.html)\n- I had an issue with posting to one blog in one tab and opening another tab and navigating to configuration for another: [I think we need a way to move a post from one blog to another.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/28/i-think-we.html)\n- I sold one of my cars right before the heatwave hit and it was far more demoralizing that I expected and set me off poorly into what turned into a bad week during the heatwave.\n- I started reading a new book: [Currently reading: The Viral Underclass by Steven W. Thrasher 📚](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/06/currently-reading-the.html)\n\n### 100 Days of Blog\n\nI started the [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge and set up this blog to do the posting exclusively for the challenge. I used a contributed Micro.blog theme and did some minor customizations, mostly digging into Hugo template overrides and getting the posts to only show a summary on the paginated listing pages. I have posted [twenty-six posts on this blog](https://100daysof.blog) for the challenge so far. I've really enjoyed the format I chose, which is to sum up the previous day or days in a sort of \"day in the life.\" I'm taking Sundays off, and occasionally other days as necessary. The cadence has not been too much so far.\n\n### 3x5.pics\n\nI am continuing posting a note every four days to 3x5.pics and I'm still really loving this little site. I submitted it for a [Tiny Award](https://tinyawards.net/) because I'm really just so in love with it. I have no idea if it is the type of thing that this award goes for, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Finalists will be announced July 19 and public voting will also open at that time.\n\n### Weblog Themes/Custom/Styles\n\nI didn't make much progress on these sites during the last six weeks. In fact, the homepage of [themes.lol](https://themes.lol) still shows my May 2024 status post, I need to get that updated within the next week, as I *have* made some progress working on [Custom](https://custom.themes.lol) over just the last few days.\n\n- I created a [Definitions](https://custom.themes.lol/definitions) page for listing out all weblog templates and configuration settings.\n- I wrote [a post on customizing a weblog homepage](https://custom.themes.lol/2024/07/customizing-a-weblog-homepage) and customized the Custom homepage at the same time.\n- I started a page on Shortcodes (aka \"tags\") for weblog that I hope to have completed soon.\n\nThat's all for now, I think it has been enough 😅 Have a great week!\n",

Please note: this was *one* four-inch nursery container when I planted it 👀—watch out!\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793569321_e0fd9153f3_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793569321_e0fd9153f3_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793569321_4b96560118_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793569321_c671349b1e_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793569321_e0fd9153f3_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"View up a basalt stepping stone path with two steps to a raised green lawn with surrounding gardens and a rockery.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>View up a basalt stepping stone path with two steps to a raised green lawn with surrounding gardens and a rockery. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXy728\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878269_417f9f5df7_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878269_417f9f5df7_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878269_b5973f2f1d_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878269_21d5b5570c_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53793878269_417f9f5df7_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"From the top step of the basalt stepping stone stairs, looking down the rockery at the top level covered in a mass of tiny blue flowers atop a pillow of blue star creeper.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>From the top step of the basalt stepping stone stairs, looking down the rockery at the top level covered in a mass of tiny blue flowers atop a pillow of blue star creeper. <b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pXzFRP\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe back perennial border is mostly full of sun loving plants that flower from now until fall, with the exception of the far west corner that falls into shade against the west fence in the afternoon.

Some things are not quite ready for prime time, I expect I will need to make an interim \"garden status\" post in a week or two to include some of the plants that really would like to be blooming already but are not.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things I found lovely today and in the past week.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53703722499_9202529166_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53703722499_9202529166_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53703722499_d36d2f2543_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53703722499_1eae6bcb3f_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53703722499_9202529166_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Fresh water drops collected in a lovely sedum with a purpley-olive green foliage.

				"content_html": "<p>Today&rsquo;s little bright spot is complicated.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning, before I&rsquo;d even made coffee or gotten out of my robe, I heard cracking. The sound of wood doing something it shouldn&rsquo;t. At first I looked outside in the direction I thought it was coming from and didn&rsquo;t see anything unusual. Or so I thought. We had a bunch of rain the day before and my neighbor&rsquo;s apricot tree, freshly laden with leaves, did appear to be hanging a bit low in front of the garage, but not <em>too</em> low.</p>\n<p>But the cracking continued. And the tree was falling. All day. Lower and lower. I went outside to try to assess what was going to happen with it, since the direct path of the fall was my garage. I had a pile of mulch in front of the garage, leftover from moving it around my yard, but directly in the way of getting the car out of the garage.</p>\n<p>So, there in my robe, having had no coffee, I shoved half the mulch pile into the wheelbarrow and over to the side of the driveway, enough so that I could get the car out of the garage, a) before something terrible happened, or b) the tree branches blocked me from doing so. I managed to do both things still in my robe.</p>\n<p>After that I concentrated on calling people: my neighbor, who I had not heard from and who I don&rsquo;t think was home, my homeowners insurance, unsure if I&rsquo;d need to make a claim, and several other neighbors to talk about the circumstances. The circumstances as they were that that tree should have come out ten years ago. I&rsquo;ve hated it since I bought this house. And apparently the neighbor knew it needed to come out and had had the tree service over <em>a week ago</em> to start the removal process.</p>\n<p>In Portland if you want to do anything with a tree, you need a permit. Unless you are planting one on private property. But if you are removing one, you need a permit. If you are planting one in a right-of-way like the parking strip, you need a permit. It&rsquo;s a system that has lofty goals but rarely works to achieve those goals and most people hate the system. First of all, it is slow. Painfully slow.</p>\n<p>So while the neighbor was waiting on a permit the tree went ahead and fell on my garage. Now, I don&rsquo;t know that they knew it was in danger of falling, but I do know that three days ago I was clearing the gutter on that side of the garage in preparation for the rain on Thursday, and I kept hitting my head on a branch <em>that didn&rsquo;t used to be there</em> so I suspect my neighbor knew something was happening and that the tree was already leaning. I did not recall this hitting-of-my-head until this morning when I was talking with the arborist.</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about this tree. It is an apricot tree, and a very large old apricot tree, most likely planted back when this neighborhood used be full of empty lots and many vegetable gardens and fruit trees. My yard likely had a fruit tree too. And that house was built in the 50s the same time my garage was built, so it is likely that that apricot tree was in an empty lot. My house was built almost 100 years ago.</p>\n<p>Apricot trees, like many stone fruit trees, like warm dry weather, they are not suited to Portland&rsquo;s climate for the most part. And that tree was never happy. Every spring it would barely bloom as we&rsquo;d get a late cold snap, and then it would try to leaf out only to be hit with a long wet spring and sporadically drop leaves, sprout more leaves, and drop leaves again. It would try to fruit, but it never succeeded, instead it dropped sappy orange goo onto my garage roof which would then dry and stick to the shingle&rsquo;s texture and rip it off. Then to top it all off, every fall it would drop all its leaves nearly at once, covering the entire east side of my garage roof, gutter, and the narrow space between the garage and neighbor&rsquo;s fence. So many leaves, so stinky, that it could fill my green compost bin three or four times.</p>\n<p>I hate(d) that tree.</p>\n<p>The neighbor was going to remove that tree. They had started the process of doing that and were planning on footing the bill. But as soon as the tree fell and endangered my property, I became responsible for part of it. This is bullshit. I looked high and low for the reasoning that I could tell them they needed to pay for the entire removal without luck. It is viewed as &ldquo;storm damage&rdquo; and if it hadn&rsquo;t damaged my garage would not even be covered by my insurance. Even with my insurance coverage I&rsquo;d still have to pay my $1000 deductible. I didn&rsquo;t know if the cost of all the removal + damage would even exceed that.</p>\n<p>Friday proved fruitless (heh 😏) in getting an arborist to come out, but my neighbor was able to get the arborist that was going to remove the tree and that was waiting on the city for a permit to come out today, Saturday. In the meantime the tree dug in, so to speak, piercing my garage roof, denting my gutter, and falling lower and lower in front of the garage door. I was under the impression that my garage was holding the entire weight of that tree for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The arborist was very kind. He was actually the owner of a very popular tree service in Portland and did all the removal of the portion on my side himself, from the top of the roof. Another crew member hauled the branches away down my driveway. I ended up paying for the hourly service of two crew members, quoted $600-700 though I have yet to be invoiced. I imagine the bulk of the tree and trunk removal to be quite a bit more than that on my neighbors side, but again, it is their tree and they were planning on removing it anyway. I am bit perturbed by this fact and that they didn&rsquo;t offer to cover the entire cost. It is frankly a bitch move and not very neighborly.</p>\n<p>We ended up being very lucky. The damage to the garage is minimal in the end: two roof shingles and a dented gutter; my neighbor&rsquo;s fence has some snapped off slats but it was in need of repair anyway. Two things were working in our favor: on my neighbor&rsquo;s side a 2x4 piece of lumber in part of their kid&rsquo;s play set was holding up part of the tree&rsquo;s weight; on my side, a 4x4 concrete-filled steel post used by a gate (overkill much?) was holding up another part of the tree&rsquo;s weight. It could have been far worse. But I&rsquo;m still under the deductible so I&rsquo;m footing all of this work and damage.</p>\n<p>So, you are asking, how is this a little bright spot, Anne? I&rsquo;m doing a lot of complaining.</p>\n<p>Well, what if I told you someone came to me months ago and said: for roughly $600 we will remove that tree that you hate so much? You will never have to clean its mess up again <em>and</em> an abundance of light would flood into your backyard making you able to possibly grow vegetables again! Yes! I would absolutely do that! I would pay $600 to never deal with that tree again!</p>",

I'm doing a lot of complaining.\n\nWell, what if I told you someone came to me months ago and said: for roughly $600 we will remove that tree that you hate so much? You will never have to clean its mess up again *and* an abundance of light would flood into your backyard making you able to possibly grow vegetables again! Yes! I would absolutely do that! I would pay $600 to never deal with that tree again!\n",

But I do foresee some of the things I'll be blogging about making their way into already active projects, such as themes.lol and even weblog proper.\n- I expand a bit on this new blogging challenge in a post: [*WeblogPoMo 2024 and tiny pages.*](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblogpomo-2024-and-tiny-pages)\n- I purchased yet another omg.lol address, 🍏, and with it I plan to set up my \"tiny pages\" to use for CSS experiments during WeblogPoMo.\n- JS Naked Day (today) made me have thoughts: [Excuse me while I beleaguer a point.](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/23/excuse-me-while.html)\n\nThat is probably all for now. As WeblogPoMo will absorb all my brain resources for the next month, I may not have a new note until it ends. Have a great week and see you in June!\n",

My neighbor tells me these plants really like a good long vernal period and we haven&rsquo;t been having those much in recent years (probably due to climate change), but this year&rsquo;s deep intense 14-15°F freeze in January must have done the trick for them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There is no end to the joy the pansies, violas, and primroses, bring me each fall/winter/spring. If my climate allowed, I&rsquo;d grow them all year.

Enjoy them while you can!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Deshojo Japanes Maple tree on the patio is fantastic this year. It&rsquo;s had a rough couple years, and I considered it being time to move it out of the container and into the ground. Unfortunately this would not happen in my garden because: a) I don&rsquo;t have the room for another tree in my garden, and b) I have had a Japanese maple succumb to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verticillium_wilt\">Verticillium wilt</a> in my garden, and other than the two Bloodgoods in the parking strip, which are quite mature and not showing any signs yet, I don&rsquo;t want to take the chance on any others. I lost a Crimson Queen and it crushed me. So, when this tree needs to get out of its container, it will leave my garden and end up elsewhere.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This tree will transition the leaves to all-green by summer time, and then back to a rainbow of hues and brilliant reds and oranges in the fall. This bright pinky-red color only lasts for a brief fleeting moment in the spring. It really is one of the best Japanese maples for color changing leaves.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The common name of this plant is &ldquo;bog rosemary&rdquo; but it isn&rsquo;t a rosemary, and it isn&rsquo;t even closely related to rosemary. Bog rosemary is more closely related to ericaceous evergreen shrubs such as huckleberry, blueberry, and cranberry. The name comes from the rosemary-esque leaves, though upon closer inspection they resemble tiny rhododendron leaves, also a relative, and its tolerance and preference for boggy growing conditions—don&rsquo;t let it dry out!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t often post pictures of the weeping white spruce (Picea Glauca &lsquo;Pendula&rsquo;) because it is sandwiched between two other trees and hard to get on its own. It usually is included in more expansive pictures of my entire backyard. But this year the tree is producing cones! Little red cones, oodles of them at the top of the tree, though I see signs of them farther down, so I&rsquo;ll need to get some pictures of them too once they develop. I got up on a ladder to get these pictures 😁</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And the final set of pictures are of a narrow upright crabapple in the back corner of my yard called &lsquo;Marilee&rsquo;. This sweet little tree produces the most adorable bright pink buds followed by classic pinky-white apple blossoms with yellow starburst centers. And they cover the branches in what appear like sleeves of blossoms.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",

My neighbor tells me these plants really like a good long vernal period and we haven't been having those much in recent years (probably due to climate change), but this year's deep intense 14-15°F freeze in January must have done the trick for them.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107698_d7f008a9a5_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107698_d7f008a9a5_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107698_68ebafd98e_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107698_4d0a71f11a_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107698_d7f008a9a5_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A purple-magenta aubrieta with variegated foliage getting ready to cascade over a terraced garden bed.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A purple-magenta aubrieta with variegated foliage getting ready to cascade over a terraced garden bed.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJwjPm\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645019032_4456887489_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645019032_4456887489_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645019032_6a0238acf4_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645019032_4ab73043d4_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645019032_4456887489_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A magenta aubrieta amongst fresh mulch next to a retaining wall.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A magenta aubrieta amongst fresh mulch next to a retaining wall.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJqKcf\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890926_e146043f0f_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890926_e146043f0f_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890926_9640cb2d47_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890926_079384065d_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890926_e146043f0f_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A blue-purple aubrieta amongst fresh mulch next to a retaining wall.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A blue-purple aubrieta amongst fresh mulch next to a retaining wall.

It's had a rough couple years, and I considered it being time to move it out of the container and into the ground. Unfortunately this would not happen in my garden because: a) I don't have the room for another tree in my garden, and b) I have had a Japanese maple succumb to [Verticillium wilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verticillium_wilt) in my garden, and other than the two Bloodgoods in the parking strip, which are quite mature and not showing any signs yet, I don't want to take the chance on any others. I lost a Crimson Queen and it crushed me. So, when this tree needs to get out of its container, it will leave my garden and end up elsewhere.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890986_17023f8287_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890986_17023f8287_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890986_0fe9ea4bca_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890986_a73b357995_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53645890986_17023f8287_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A Japanese Maple tree with small bright pinky-red leaves in a container on a patio.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A Japanese Maple tree with small bright pinky-red leaves in a container on a patio.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJvdoW\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis tree will transition the leaves to all-green by summer time, and then back to a rainbow of hues and brilliant reds and oranges in the fall.

Bog rosemary is more closely related to ericaceous evergreen shrubs such as huckleberry, blueberry, and cranberry. The name comes from the rosemary-esque leaves, though upon closer inspection they resemble tiny rhododendron leaves, also a relative, and its tolerance and preference for boggy growing conditions—don't let it dry out!\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107853_70145f1e59_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107853_70145f1e59_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107853_ff8708fa25_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107853_a1b3ccd332_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107853_70145f1e59_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A top-down view of a bog rosemary with oodles of small pink bell-like blooms on soft green-blue rosemary-type leaves.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A top-down view of a bog rosemary with oodles of small pink bell-like blooms on soft green-blue rosemary-type leaves.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJwjS2\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107858_6f6e61554b_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107858_6f6e61554b_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107858_28a7596165_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107858_9b08173f79_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646107858_6f6e61554b_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A closeup view of a bog rosemary with oodles of small pink bell-like blooms on soft green-blue rosemary-type leaves.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>A closeup view of a bog rosemary with oodles of small pink bell-like blooms on soft green-blue rosemary-type leaves.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJwjS7\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI don't often post pictures of the weeping white spruce (Picea Glauca 'Pendula') because it is sandwiched between two other trees and hard to get on its own. It usually is included in more expansive pictures of my entire backyard. But this year the tree is producing cones! Little red cones, oodles of them at the top of the tree, though I see signs of them farther down, so I'll need to get some pictures of them too once they develop. I got up on a ladder to get these pictures 😁\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646233419_dc4c388cda_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646233419_dc4c388cda_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646233419_fc9c0eddad_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646233419_5e4f995359_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646233419_dc4c388cda_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Tiny pinkish-red cones appear on a bluish-white foliage conifer, blue sky behind.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Tiny pinkish-red cones appear on a bluish-white foliage conifer, blue sky behind.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJwYbX\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646108008_0920f1df13_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646108008_0920f1df13_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646108008_bed2743f7d_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646108008_6b7b34aa06_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53646108008_0920f1df13_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Even more tiny pinkish-red cones appear on a bluish-white foliage conifer, blue sky behind.\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>Even more tiny pinkish-red cones appear on a bluish-white foliage conifer, blue sky behind.<br><b>Image source:</b> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2pJwjUG\" rel=\"me\">@anniegreens</a> on Flickr.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAnd the final set of pictures are of a narrow upright crabapple in the back corner of my yard called 'Marilee'.

I'll be using this when I need to cheer myself up or at least take some focus off all the bad stuff.\n- Back on weblog, I took the [Blogroll](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/blogroll) for a [second spin](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/blogroll-spin-2).\n- I resumed work on themes.lol:\n  - On styles, I wrote about [adding color swatches and continuing work on HTML element styling](https://styles.themes.lol/2024/03/color-swatches-html-elements) and added a [Style List](https://styles.themes.lol/style) landing page.\n  - On custom, I wrote a post about [customizing weblog header](https://custom.themes.lol/2024/03/customizing-weblog-header) and created a [post archive page](https://custom.themes.lol/posts).\n  - On themes, I published a [March update](https://themes.lol/2024/03/march-2024-updates).\n- After writing about technical things and doing technical work, I sometimes lose the motivation for blogging about interests and life, and I find [inspiration hits me at the wrong time](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/04/the-motivation-to.html).\n- After two spins of the Blogroll + the initial set, [I reviewed a trend in blog names](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/give-your-blog-a-name).\n- I wrote a little ranty post about [services that force users onto \"choose account\" pages](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/many-services-are.html) even when there is only one user account.\n- I upgraded to Micro.blog premium for several reasons, not immediately to be used, but something I had been dragging my feet on for a while. I found that existing bookmarks don't appear to archive? I'm not sure if that's a bug or something that is expected. I began using the Notes feature for tracking my featured photos series and using it to organize and plan ahead for the posts.\n- I published a first post in the series [My ME Life](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/05/my-me-life.html).\n- There was a point within the last week that I realized that now that I have Micro.blog premium, and I already have five active omg.lol weblogs, I have the potential for *ten* blogs—how many blogs is too many blogs? I also have nine sites (not all blogs) using Tinylytics right now.\n- And finally, back to that \"note\" thing I was hinting at, I finally got [3x5.pics](https://3x5.pics) [setup, designed, and mostly in a good place](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/08/xpics-is-now.html) while I continue to move things around and make it what I want.\n\nAnd that's longer than a *note*, so long that Micro.blog's preview threw a `414 Request-URI Too Large` for previewing 😆 I think that is my cue to end it here. Take care and have a great week!\n",

Then this past week, just within the last three days, I started brainstorming and working with some design ideas. I went searching for the perfect 3x5 notecard online and was prepared to shell out for some new pens to get just the right ink-on-paper feel, but I was less than satisfied with the notecards I was finding.

				"content_html": "<p>It has been nearly a month since I wrote a Some Day Note! In realizing this a week ago I fretted a bit but then by putting it off another week I now can just use this as a reason to write a year-end note. But of course, I had to come up with a <em>name</em> because if there&rsquo;s one thing I like to do, it is to name things.</p>\n<p>Grandiloquent Notes is born!</p>\n<p>I was trying to generate a name that somewhat poked fun at year-end traditions. I&rsquo;ve always disliked resolutions. The idea of looking back at an entire year and prophesying always felt bombastic. I was actually trending towards some rather morbid terms but then decided against that.</p>\n<p>I landed on &ldquo;grandiloquent&rdquo; by rabbit-holing on Merriam-Webster from &ldquo;note&rdquo; to &ldquo;resonant&rdquo; to &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; to &ldquo;grandiloquence&rdquo; to &ldquo;grandiloquent,&rdquo; which ultimately is &ldquo;grand speech&rdquo; from Latin <em>loqui</em> (to speak) and <em>grandis</em> (grand or great). I think this is just about perfect: pokes fun at the thing but at the same time gives me permission to go with it. My favorite type of naming.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>\n<p>As with the previous three years, 2023 has been a tough one. The world just wants to move on from something that refuses to move on from them. Denials on the continued spread of a disease that is killing and disabling thousands is on all of us and should sit with you during this season. Many people will stay home alone due to conditions they already have that prevent them from even taking a chance of catching it lest it make them worse, or kill them. Many more will gather with supposed loved ones and spread that disease, knowingly or unknowingly. I don&rsquo;t know how we tackle some of our existential societal challenges if we can&rsquo;t even agree on this. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say on it. This is one of the hardest times in my life and I&rsquo;ve lost so much faith in my fellow humans.</p>\n<p>On a much more positive note, though I will not go as extensively into it as I will in an upcoming weblog post, I sort of fell into joining a few online &ldquo;communities&rdquo; this year. I spent 18 months in 2018 and 2019 in the worst stages of burnout at a job I&rsquo;d ever encountered. It broke me so badly, and then was followed up by a global pandemic and waves of intense hiring and firing, that I had basically vowed to never work in the industry again. I went <em>years</em> without writing a single line of code. I fell into omg.lol in late January 2023 after: a) coming across the social.lol Mastodon instance and wanting to join it, and b) hearing the Do By Friday episode where they talked about it.</p>\n<p>I then also signed up for Micro.blog, but forgot about it (I have talked about this elsewhere before) until the summer when I finally subscribed and got moving on incorporating a microblog into the rest of my web life. Over the next 11 months I&rsquo;ve pretty much changed my whole feeling on the web and tech industry. I&rsquo;ve jumped back in with some reservations and boundaries that I will attempt to hold onto lest I fall into the same traps that burned me before. I am concentrating on the small, intentional, and independent web and purposely avoiding the capitalist web. If I hope to ever work on the web again, it won&rsquo;t be <em>for</em> but rather <em>with.</em> An important distinction. I will not let capitalism consume my remaining years.</p>\n<p>This year has also seen some hard times in my family. I&rsquo;m getting up there in age, but my parents are <em>really</em> getting up there in age. My father is now the primary caretaker of house and home, where it was always my mother before her recent health issues. He&rsquo;s having to learn how to do everything that he never had to do before. She&rsquo;s cognitively declining but also fighting a body that is slowly deteriorating beneath her. Eventually I will need to be closer to them as my father is going to start to fail at some point too.

				"content_text": "It has been nearly a month since I wrote a Some Day Note! In realizing this a week ago I fretted a bit but then by putting it off another week I now can just use this as a reason to write a year-end note. But of course, I had to come up with a *name* because if there's one thing I like to do, it is to name things.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nGrandiloquent Notes is born!\n\nI was trying to generate a name that somewhat poked fun at year-end traditions. I've always disliked resolutions. The idea of looking back at an entire year and prophesying always felt bombastic. I was actually trending towards some rather morbid terms but then decided against that.\n\nI landed on \"grandiloquent\" by rabbit-holing on Merriam-Webster from \"note\" to \"resonant\" to \"resonance\" to \"grandiloquence\" to \"grandiloquent,\" which ultimately is \"grand speech\" from Latin *loqui* (to speak) and *grandis* (grand or great). I think this is just about perfect: pokes fun at the thing but at the same time gives me permission to go with it. My favorite type of naming.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\nAs with the previous three years, 2023 has been a tough one. The world just wants to move on from something that refuses to move on from them. Denials on the continued spread of a disease that is killing and disabling thousands is on all of us and should sit with you during this season. Many people will stay home alone due to conditions they already have that prevent them from even taking a chance of catching it lest it make them worse, or kill them. Many more will gather with supposed loved ones and spread that disease, knowingly or unknowingly. I don't know how we tackle some of our existential societal challenges if we can't even agree on this. That's all I'm going to say on it. This is one of the hardest times in my life and I've lost so much faith in my fellow humans.\n\nOn a much more positive note, though I will not go as extensively into it as I will in an upcoming weblog post, I sort of fell into joining a few online \"communities\" this year. I spent 18 months in 2018 and 2019 in the worst stages of burnout at a job I'd ever encountered. It broke me so badly, and then was followed up by a global pandemic and waves of intense hiring and firing, that I had basically vowed to never work in the industry again. I went *years* without writing a single line of code. I fell into omg.lol in late January 2023 after: a) coming across the social.lol Mastodon instance and wanting to join it, and b) hearing the Do By Friday episode where they talked about it.\n\nI then also signed up for Micro.blog, but forgot about it (I have talked about this elsewhere before) until the summer when I finally subscribed and got moving on incorporating a microblog into the rest of my web life. Over the next 11 months I've pretty much changed my whole feeling on the web and tech industry. I've jumped back in with some reservations and boundaries that I will attempt to hold onto lest I fall into the same traps that burned me before. I am concentrating on the small, intentional, and independent web and purposely avoiding the capitalist web. If I hope to ever work on the web again, it won't be *for* but rather *with.* An important distinction. I will not let capitalism consume my remaining years.\n\nThis year has also seen some hard times in my family. I'm getting up there in age, but my parents are *really* getting up there in age. My father is now the primary caretaker of house and home, where it was always my mother before her recent health issues. He's having to learn how to do everything that he never had to do before. She's cognitively declining but also fighting a body that is slowly deteriorating beneath her. Eventually I will need to be closer to them as my father is going to start to fail at some point too. I imagine 2024 to be tumultuous in many ways.\n\nI participated in two monthly photography challenges on Micro.blog, one in March before I was *on* Micro.blog (even though I already had an account! silly me...) and another in September. I enjoyed these but rather also enjoy my personal habit of posting a (nearly) daily featured photo from the iPadOS Photos app. I started writing semi-regular \"notes\" called Some Day Notes (reference above, tied to this note), also on my microblog.

And now my whole web world lives on a custom domain: anniegreens.lol. I've put so much into it I'm now on a side quest to create styles and custom patterns for weblog themes. I acquired three new omg.lol addresses: styles, custom, and themes (the last one gifted to me by omg.lol) as well as another domain: themes.lol. I will be working on this in the coming months.\n\nI think the above covers my \"big ticket items\" for the year.

				"content_html": "<p>It might be cliché but I figured I&rsquo;d give this sort of post a shot this year. These are thoughts I&rsquo;ve had before but never written them down (or typed them, as be the case). Seems like the right kind of day, Thanksgiving, to document them.</p>\n<p>I just wrapped up a three-part series on a subject that has been inside me and growing for the last five or six years. I consider it a first draft even though it is published on weblog. I do expect to revisit it and refine it over time. It was tough to write. It was sitting in Drafts since March or April and I just couldn&rsquo;t get a move-on finishing it.</p>\n<p>It has been a tough few years, I think for everyone the world over. Sometimes I think people have a hard time sitting with their grief and really letting it take ahold of them. But I think that is an important process and it never goes as planned nor takes the time we expect it should. I consider the last five to six year of my life to be one rolling grief process, not all about one thing, and not all at the same time. It has felt like just as I was rounding the corner something else was there to surprise me again.</p>\n<p>Through it all I&rsquo;ve been immensely grateful for my mother and father. At the beginning of the pandemic, for the first year, as I was still reeling with burnout from my job, I was only concerned about their well-being and keeping them alive until vaccines became available. During the second year I lost an uncle to Covid. My parents are still alive, though my mother&rsquo;s health is declining, due to factors unknown, though I have suspicions. However, I&rsquo;m thankful to still have a good relationship with them and be within driving distance.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m thankful I still have my home. Through this time I&rsquo;m not sure how I would have gotten by with my illness if I had to share space with anyone else who wasn&rsquo;t as careful as I need them to be. Not only as careful, but as honest as I would need them to be.

				"content_text": "It might be cliché but I figured I'd give this sort of post a shot this year. These are thoughts I've had before but never written them down (or typed them, as be the case). Seems like the right kind of day, Thanksgiving, to document them.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI just wrapped up a three-part series on a subject that has been inside me and growing for the last five or six years. I consider it a first draft even though it is published on weblog. I do expect to revisit it and refine it over time. It was tough to write. It was sitting in Drafts since March or April and I just couldn't get a move-on finishing it.\n\nIt has been a tough few years, I think for everyone the world over. Sometimes I think people have a hard time sitting with their grief and really letting it take ahold of them. But I think that is an important process and it never goes as planned nor takes the time we expect it should. I consider the last five to six year of my life to be one rolling grief process, not all about one thing, and not all at the same time. It has felt like just as I was rounding the corner something else was there to surprise me again.\n\nThrough it all I've been immensely grateful for my mother and father. At the beginning of the pandemic, for the first year, as I was still reeling with burnout from my job, I was only concerned about their well-being and keeping them alive until vaccines became available. During the second year I lost an uncle to Covid. My parents are still alive, though my mother's health is declining, due to factors unknown, though I have suspicions. However, I'm thankful to still have a good relationship with them and be within driving distance.\n\nI'm thankful I still have my home. Through this time I'm not sure how I would have gotten by with my illness if I had to share space with anyone else who wasn't as careful as I need them to be. Not only as careful, but as honest as I would need them to be. People don't want to always share their carelessness or mistakes and that honesty is life or death to immunocompromised people.\n\nI'm also grateful my home has the space for a garden. I have painted this garden like a canvas, every single plant I put in myself (or via the gardener I used to have help me when I was still working full-time and had less expendable time to spend working in the yard).

So all the way from my mid-20s until my mid-30s I went without, except when visiting my parents. I lived in apartments, one of which was in a Pearl District tower surrounded by other large buildings, and faced north. That was a dark time indeed. For seven years I lived in that lovely cave and my well-being suffered from it. It faced the Weiden+Kennedy building and I remember one year they started putting a lights-only Christmas tree on the roof-top deck. That was my Christmas tree.</p>\n<p>So now this slowly decorated tree will sit in a corner through November, December, and January, and won&rsquo;t come down until February, sometimes all the way until Valentine&rsquo;s Day. It has helped so much. I&rsquo;m even considering adding some exterior lights this year. I have a pre-lit garland for the front porch, but I&rsquo;m thinking of something different that I can see from my upstairs. My garage has a window facing out to the back yard and there is a plain unadorned grapevine wreath hanging on the inside of it. I want to string it up with lights and put it on a timer. The only people that will see it will be me and my immediate neighbors via their back yards. I sort of love that idea.

For the remainder of November I'll slowly bring up decorations and adornments and take my time putting trinkets and ribbon and garland all over the tree. I'm not a giant Christmas fan, but something about this slow moving tradition, that I often spend by myself, is cathartic.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/100386/2023/119651be30.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"A nighttime view out a window to a building across the way, the white metal railing of a roof deck just visible by the light of an all-light Christmas tree set up on the deck, with large brightly colored bulbs.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"img-masthead__caption\">\n    <cite><small>The brightly colored bulbs of the Weiden+Kennedy lights-only Christmas tree on their roof-top deck, circa 2010.</small></cite>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI didn't have a Christmas tree at all until I bought this house twelve years ago. So all the way from my mid-20s until my mid-30s I went without, except when visiting my parents. I lived in apartments, one of which was in a Pearl District tower surrounded by other large buildings, and faced north. That was a dark time indeed. For seven years I lived in that lovely cave and my well-being suffered from it. It faced the Weiden+Kennedy building and I remember one year they started putting a lights-only Christmas tree on the roof-top deck. That was my Christmas tree.\n\nSo now this slowly decorated tree will sit in a corner through November, December, and January, and won't come down until February, sometimes all the way until Valentine's Day. It has helped so much. I'm even considering adding some exterior lights this year. I have a pre-lit garland for the front porch, but I'm thinking of something different that I can see from my upstairs. My garage has a window facing out to the back yard and there is a plain unadorned grapevine wreath hanging on the inside of it. I want to string it up with lights and put it on a timer. The only people that will see it will be me and my immediate neighbors via their back yards. I sort of love that idea. Like a little secret circle of warmth.\n\n---\n\n[NaBloPoMo](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/nablopomo/): 15/30\n\nPOSSE copies:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://status.anniegreens.lol/655536ffa2055\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on Statuslog</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://social.lol/@anniegreens/111416669344370343\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on social.lol</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I do recall seeing feather fuzz all about and thinking it was an odd time for molting. The fuzz was someone&rsquo;s brunch. I looked up into the apricot tree and not six feet away was a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk staring back at me, fresh catch in talons, feathers all over the large moss covered branch, and little bit of something on its beak.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I was completely taken aback. I&rsquo;ve seen a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk twice around my yard. In fact, I just had a short conversation about this on Mastodon a week or so ago. The first encounter I was bent over in my front yard and just as I was standing up straight a Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk was swooping over the top of me, recognized by its thickly banded tail feathers. The second encounter was in the back yard, I was upright this time, and it came straight out of the group of trees near the garages and torpedoed over the top of me, again very recognizable.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This time the bird was caught off guard too. Like I said, the neighborhood was very quiet today, hardly any humans around. I remembered being upstairs and hearing the crows making a ruckus, they were definitely not happy with something and I first thought it might be a Red-tailed Hawk, which very often get mobbed by the crows from all around when they dare to land in a large tree. I think now it was the Cooper&rsquo;s, but the hawk still got its meal.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I managed to get some photos, because I don&rsquo;t think it quite knew what to do about me. I was very close and I don&rsquo;t think they see well at close distances. We were both in/under the tree so it was pretty dim light and I only had my iPhone, and not a very new one either. I talked to it for a little while and didn&rsquo;t make many quick moves, but I did go back and forth to my rolling compost bin to empty several buckets of leaves and it remained on the branch the entire time, though frozen and no longer eating its catch. Eventually I went around the back of the garage out of sight and when I came back it was gone.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/nablopomo/\">NaBloPoMo</a>: 11/30</p>\n<p>POSSE copies:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",

Here, I encountered a surprise.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852354_14016e9d87_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852354_14016e9d87_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852354_10d3157ddf_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852354_f436068d80_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852354_14016e9d87_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Another dimly lit view into a gnarly old apricot tree, thick moss covered branches arch around and fall colored, but very few, leaves hang on.

I'd formed several good sized piles, but something made me look up. I do recall seeing feather fuzz all about and thinking it was an odd time for molting. The fuzz was someone's brunch. I looked up into the apricot tree and not six feet away was a Cooper's Hawk staring back at me, fresh catch in talons, feathers all over the large moss covered branch, and little bit of something on its beak.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852249_aa822953d0_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852249_aa822953d0_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852249_2d98438ee9_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852249_b5cdf4b3fb_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325852249_aa822953d0_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Another dimly lit view into a gnarly old apricot tree, thick moss covered branches arch around and fall colored, but very few, leaves hang on.

I've seen a Cooper's Hawk twice around my yard. In fact, I just had a short conversation about this on Mastodon a week or so ago. The first encounter I was bent over in my front yard and just as I was standing up straight a Cooper's Hawk was swooping over the top of me, recognized by its thickly banded tail feathers. The second encounter was in the back yard, I was upright this time, and it came straight out of the group of trees near the garages and torpedoed over the top of me, again very recognizable.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325969030_82e40c9acb_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325969030_82e40c9acb_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325969030_680fa0fd4f_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325969030_e68b46d780_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325969030_82e40c9acb_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"A brighter view into a gnarly old apricot tree, thick moss covered branches arch around and fall colored, but very few, leaves hang on.

Like I said, the neighborhood was very quiet today, hardly any humans around. I remembered being upstairs and hearing the crows making a ruckus, they were definitely not happy with something and I first thought it might be a Red-tailed Hawk, which very often get mobbed by the crows from all around when they dare to land in a large tree. I think now it was the Cooper's, but the hawk still got its meal.\n\n<figure class=\"img-masthead\">\n  <img srcset=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325744213_2bd392e711_w.jpg 400w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325744213_2bd392e711_c.jpg 800w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325744213_a6cb6018fd_h.jpg 1600w,\n               https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325744213_5576f38d4f_k.jpg 2048w\"\n       sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 400px, (max-width: 800px) 800px, (max-width: 1600px) 1600px, 2048px\"\n       src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325744213_2bd392e711_c.jpg\"\n       alt=\"Another brighter view into a gnarly old apricot tree, thick moss covered branches arch around and fall colored, but very few, leaves hang on.

I was very close and I don't think they see well at close distances. We were both in/under the tree so it was pretty dim light and I only had my iPhone, and not a very new one either. I talked to it for a little while and didn't make many quick moves, but I did go back and forth to my rolling compost bin to empty several buckets of leaves and it remained on the branch the entire time, though frozen and no longer eating its catch. Eventually I went around the back of the garage out of sight and when I came back it was gone.\n\n---\n\n[NaBloPoMo](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/categories/nablopomo/): 11/30\n\nPOSSE copies:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://status.anniegreens.lol/65501b9ddedd8\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on Statuslog</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://social.lol/@anniegreens/111394735058289847\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on social.lol</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://mstdn.social/@anniegreens/111394750535898757\" rel=\"syndication\">Shared on mstdn.social</a></li>\n",

I've only had them set up for a few days but am already liking the improved video quality and the automatic mode switching that occurs via Home members coming and going. They also use Apple Secure Video which is stored in iCloud.\n- So glad that the baking and soup season is upon us! I made an [ad hoc soup](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/06/i-wanted-to.html) last week to celebrate despite the hot weather and it turned out to be delicious. I would make it again!\n- My weblog post [\"The picture element for unexpected art direction.\"](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/10/the-picture-element-for-unexpected-art-direction) made it in [Friday Front-End](https://hachyderm.io/@fridayfrontend/111211790282638825)! I am both humbled and horrified.\n\nAnother note with quite a few entries, I suppose that's enough for now—take care and have a great week!\n",

Though not necessarily a speed issue, the software just sucks. Siri is worse than ever.\n",
